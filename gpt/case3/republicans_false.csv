One of the most comprehensive studies of recent active shooter events suggests the average of 18 deaths when police stop the shooter is far too high. The study of more than 100 incidents determined the median number of people killed or wounded in all active shooter situations was five. The study documented only nine incidents out of dozens in which the number of people shot was 14 or higher. Conclusions about the number of deaths when an armed civilian takes action are also problematic because very limited data exists. The author of the study agrees its logical to assume casualties would be lower when civilians intervene before police arrive, but his research documented very few incidents that were actually stopped because a civilian was carrying a gun. Rubens has since revised his estimate to be in the range of 2. 33 and 14. Overall, this statement is not accurate."

It is in the matter of foreign policy that Romney lays out the most aggressive case against Obama, warning that the United States needs to maintain its military dominance in the world, particularly in the face of threats from China, Russia and Islamic jihadists.

If you think American presidents should never admit to any sort of error at any time, you might find yourself in philosophical agreement with Romney's criticisms. We set out to discover whether Obama really had apologized in his speeches, and what he was apologizing for. But in our review of his words, we came up short. Yes, there is criticism in some of his speeches, but it's typically leavened by praise for the United States and its ideals, and often he mentions other countries and how they have erred as well.

Harold Metts said, ""Rhode Island has a recidivism rate of over 60 percent. ""For better or worse, recidivism rates are usually calculated based on how many former inmates are found guilty of a subsequent crime and end up back in prison within three years. The most recent data from the Department of Corrections cover two years and the rate is 42 percent. The most recent study to look at a three-year period, which covered inmates released in 2004, put the rate at 54 percent. The only way to get above 60 percent is to use the older study and look at an entirely different category: the number of ex-convicts who were brought back to the ACI because they had been charged with a new crime or with violating their probation. But that percentage is flawed as well because it includes at least some people who would never have seen a jail cell if they had been able to afford bail. Metts offered his ""over 60 percent"" as a definitive statistic. Although most of the measures we saw offered a lower number, those studies only followed the former inmates for three years or less, an artificial cutoff that makes it easier to collect statistics yet doesn't reflect the fact that anyone who goes back to prison after three years is still regarded as a recidivist. The bottom line: the longer inmates are followed, the higher the percentages get."

""While Romney appears to have favored cap and trade in the past, his actions as governor better prove his skepticism of the policy than his support for it. When he could have signed it into law, he declined. And more recently, Romney has repeatedly said hes opposed to it. UPDATE, Feb.  22, 2012 After we published this story, a reader pointed us to an air pollution plan Romney proposed that was specific to Massachusetts power plants. It was separate from the regional compact that we noted in the original item. The state proposal set emissions limits on power plants and included a ""safety valve"" feature which allowed the companies to buy emission offsets from environmental programs rather than make the reductions in their own facilities. ""You could reduce your emissions or pay into some alternative compliance fund,"" said Billy Pizer, a Duke University professor who helped develop the plan. ""He (Romney) was looking for mechanisms that would still serve the goals of the program but would limit the financial exposure of the regulated firms. ""To Pizer, these carbon limits dont fit the definition of cap and trade. ""Maybe youd call it the same family, but its different because youre telling each source, heres what your limit is, but you can buy reductions from these other programs. This idea of trying to limit businesses exposure from compliance costs is not a feature of cap and trade. ""We also talked to Fred Bayles, a former reporter for the Associated Press and USA Today who covered Romneys administration. He now teaches at Boston University. In Bayles opinion, the Massachusetts pollution regulations ""fit the broad definition of cap and trade. ""But he added, ""its in the eye of the beholder. ""We think the emission limits Romney put in place might still raise the hackles of Santorum and other critics of cap and trade. But his program lacked the feature most commonly associated with cap and trade -- namely, an allowance for companies that come in below their emission caps to sell credits to other polluters. The new information adds some helpful details about Romney's position in the past. It is consistent with what we said in our original story, above, that Romney had expressed some support for cap and trade but backed away from it when he declined to sign on to a regional cap and trade pact."

In 2010, he vetoed a bill to require women to undergo ultrasounds before they have an abortion. He's also called himself both ""pro-life"" and ""pro-choice,"" and he seems comfortable offering up his own personal definitions of the terms. If he's shown a kernel of consistency, it's that he often -- but not always -- talked about being personally ""pro-life"" but wanting to respect the right of women to make decisions with their doctors and without government interference.
