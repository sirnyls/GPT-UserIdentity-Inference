Trumps point about the U. S.  shipping coal toChina is even less accurate. U. S.  coal exports to China comprise only a tiny fraction of all U. S.  coal exports, and U.

If you compare Dec.  31 figures from 2005 to 2009, the executive workforce -- controlled by the governor -- dropped by 2,909 full-time equivalents. The decrease appears largely because of the number of temporary employees on Virginias payroll at the close of 2005.
