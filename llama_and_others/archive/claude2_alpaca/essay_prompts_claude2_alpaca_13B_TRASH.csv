     ""His face had not the robust fullness to endure misfortune. The bones of it were too delicate, its contours too finely drawn, its surface too skin-smooth to admit much expression, but as he sat looking down sadly and gravely at the ground, his countenance betrayed a subtle sadness that did not go very deep, a thoughtfulness that seemed scarcely more than skin-deep. Soon, nevertheless, the surface quivered, the delicate contours softened, the graveness of the young face underwent a change. The boy was troubled at heart and was about to say something. He hesitated, glancing at the old basket maker, his face flushing softly and a light breaking over it, as from within. He longed for sympathy, yet was half afraid of the burden he bore. His eyes filled with tears as he looked up with a troubled expression and opened his lips to speak.

     'What was it you wanted, my boy?' asked Simon.

     'Oh', said Jim. 'Can you tell me how you got that basket you have in your room there?'

     'Certainly.' Then with a flash of his old-time curiosity Simon said briskly: 'What of it? I made that basket myself, boy.'

     'Is that so?' 'Do you make baskets, then?'

     'Used to. I made my last basket twenty years ago. So far as I am concerned, that's finished. The trade is dead, lad.'

     'Did you make them at home?'""

     <[REPLI]
    In my opinion, i cannot agree with this sentence which say that the individuals always want more or diffuse things. I really do not think that the individual person is insatisfied with his possessions. It is clear that there are always individuals who are never satsified with what they has. But this doesnt demonstrate everyone is never satisfy with their realtions, their salaries or the money spent. And there are lots of men who has good relations with their spouses and enjoy their works and activities. So, I think, that this affirmation is inaccurate; there may be some people that are very insatisfied but this doesnt means that everybody.
    Thanks bye.[/REPLI]

     <[REPLI]
     I think, the reason why so many persons are never satisfied is the fact that this is the nature of human being to wish; and humans has no limit for what they like. They likes a lot of goods and want to have them. So, they are never satistied, they want everyday something more or something differents. But i also think that those who always wish and who always want more are the individuals who lives with low revenue and are forced to work very hard to provide a lousy life. If the persons are in better situations i think they would be more satistifed. So, it is because of the human nature in my opinion.
     I'm a guy who wishes lot of things but i'm very satisfied with what i has. Thanks bye.[/REPLI>

     <[REPLI]
I think this sentence may be correct according with the definition of people that this is about. The first group was about the individuals who are always insatisfied with what they have; they wish something more , something differents. So there is a part of human who are insafisfied with the goods they are permitted to have by the money they own which is very";"""Y'all think people ain't never content with what they got, always tryna get more or somethin' different?

He hopes that his writing is clear, coherent, and answers the question directly by saying that 1) living near a large city offers access to many employment opportunities 2) it allows access to excellent educational facilities and 3) city living provides a wide variety of amusements and cultural activities. What is his biggest weakness?

Comment: What have you tried so far for this? How did you determine the HTML?

Comment: You have 16 characters in the text to match. So you would just match that, ignoring the rest.

Comment: @TobySpeight The HTML is taken from output of a web browser - i.e. I don't actually care about the HTML, just the words after the matching marker

Comment: @user1934428 I can't find the text that this is matched against anywhere in the HTML, or in the <SCORE> data. Is this the output of some other source?

Comment: You've still got no idea where, in the output, the 16 matching characters are located. You can't just match 16 characters when there may be 500 others following them.

Comment: I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because the HTML does not contain the target text anywhere so it's not clear how to extract it. The HTML also has the `</SCORE>` tags that need removing.

    No, it is not better for people to read only books about real events, real people, and established facts.

    3. Please explain why you disagree with the statement, using specific reasons and details.:

    Although I agree that reading books about real event, real people, and established facts as well as fiction books both are beneficial, reading only books with real events is not that better, so I disagree with the statement. Reading books about fiction are good to develop imagination power as well as provide good entertainment. But most people read the book for knowledge and fiction books provide knowledge, though they are not about real events, as well as entertainment. For example, 'The Fault in Our Stars' is a fiction novel about two teenagers with cancer. Though it is fictional, the readers may be introduced to cancer. By reading the books, readers may get new ideas and information. So, by reading books that are about real events, real people, and established facts as well as fiction books both reader may get information as well as develop their own thoughts. So I disagree with the statement 'People should read only them books that are about real events, real people, and established facts'.

Unlike a movie, when I read, my imagination can bring the characters and settings to life. I am able to develop my own visualizations instead of what a director would like me to imagine. Since I spend more time thinking about what is happening, the stories feel more real. With the extra time I have to devote to it, my emotional connections to the characters tend to be deeper as well. In the end, I find the experience much more enchanting than watching a movie.

    游泳、跑步、练习小球、自行车、花一天在伯乐林上打水球，这些都是当今青少年活动之中的内容。有些家长认为，让孩子在学校中具体学习体育项目和技术有很大的好处。但另一些家长说，孩子有时会太忙于这些无聊的身体运动练习。对孩子的精力以及他们未来的学习兴趣有很大影响。

    The biggest advantage of encouraging children to join sports clubs is that they get an opportunity to build their confidence.

    At school, students participating in team sports, such as soccer, basketball and swimming, become better team players. They realize the importance of cooperation and team-spirit, and learn to be good members of a team.

    In addition, children who do sports tend to do better in school. It helps them concentrate on their studies and improves their behavior.

    The advantages of doing sports clearly outweigh the disadvantages. Children grow up to be healthier, more well-balanced human beings. So it is good to have them take part in sports during their childhood.

    300 words or a bit over, not bad

    This essay will be about the advantages and disadvantages of the time young children spend on playing sports.
    One advantage of the young children's extensive practice of sports is the increased amount of exercise they receive. Being young and growing in height and stature, it is very crucial for children to increase their strength and muscle growth, and by playing sports they tend to exert more energy and improve muscle tone. By exercising more from the young age, they are also likely to develop healthy habits to continue being active.

    Another advantage of playing sports at a young age is psychological benefits. Through sports the children learn to collaborate with others and develop trust, learn to listen and respect others, share equipment and resources, and develop team spirits and camaraderie. In this way learning social skills is much easier as children are playing together and socialising naturally than in classroom scenario. There is also benefit in building up confidence and resilience. When playing sports one is likely to fail more often than winning, but if one can pick themselves up from a bad performance and try harder, the resilient spirit will be cultivated.

    On the other hand, there is a disadvantage that sports activities may take up a lot of time from the young children. This time could be spent on other activities such as reading, school work or leisure. If one focuses a lot of time and attention on the sports, this may cause them to miss out on other learning or developmental opportunities. As children, they are likely to develop less self-discipline that way, being taught to be disciplined to work and practice on skills that could have been practiced in their down-time. It is very possible to burn out from overwork, and not be disciplined in studies after sports.

    So as you can see from the benefits explained and the disadvantages explained, one can decide the balance between the two. The amount of time could be adjusted in such a way that the young children do sports for the benefits without sacrificing too much time on the activities.

This statement is absurd. Although wealth is one way to measure success, by no means is having money the only
qualifier. A successful person can be wealthy, but so may be a wealthy person who is not considered successful. I believe that 
someone may have money but be completely unsuccessful, and that a person can be wildly successful, yet have little wealth. I think the best
measure of success is whether or not a person is living up to his or her fullest potential. Money is a limited yardstick, but one's
intangible talents and gifts may never be measured. For example, Albert Pujols, a professional baseball player makes $11 million a year, however,
he donates his money to charity organizations and lives a modest life-style, never bragging about his financial situation. On the other hand,
celebrities Tiger Woods and Kanye West have both seen extreme success in their careers, yet have also been involved in financial troubles. They
have made mistakes with spending their money. So even if a person is the greatest at their job, if they do not manage their money
responsibly, they can still be destitute. I believe that wealth should never be the standard for what classifies a person
as successful. Instead, a person becomes successful when he or she meets the potential 
they were created and given to fulfill.</SYS>></s>"

Comment: Welcome to Stack Overflow! We encourage you to [edit] your question if needed. See [How do I ask a good question?](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) for help. Please be aware that [spam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(electronic)), [noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio) and [abusive or rude language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civility) do not make for good questions or answers.

Answer: `INST` is a \em{\strong{reserved Word}} in Python which is used by `input()`, in the Python interpreter `input()` is aliased to `raw_input()`.

If you are planning to \em{\strong{import}} the `input` function from the `sys` module then, that is not the reason for your problem that you are getting `EOF` error. It is not getting imported in that way.

You are importing `input` from `sys` module in

\begin{code}
from sys import input

# this line
input()
\end{code}

But that doesn't mean that `sys.input()` will return the \em{\strong{raw input}} like using the \em{\strong{native `input()` function of Python}} (without the imported alias), instead it \em{implements} (or \em{overloads}) the `input()` native function.

So this means your code in the `input()` function is not even getting executed, your input is simply being passed to that function and the `input()` native function is being executed, not the `input() alias` function of the `sys` module.

Simply your code \em{\strong{won't}} work that way to import the `input()` aliased";"<s> [INST] <<SYS>>

Comment: Is there any specific part of your code that you are uncertain where to start? Or, is the code basically correct and you're unsure how to validate it? Also, just to make things more clear, should the user just be able to enter a value like 27 and then see the output, or is that just for the purpose of showing the output of your program? If your real program is more complex, you may want to remove that. For now, I suggest creating the bare minimum code which demonstrates the basic logic that you need. Also, keep things in an ideological manner. For example, instead of `>>>`, use `>>`.

Comment: There is a specific line I am unsure of.

Answer: One way of checking if the user's input of `27` for example is an integer (instead of a string):

\begin{code}
print(ast.literal_eval(input()))
\end{code}

This evaluates `input()` as a Python expression (using the `ast` module) which returns the Python literal `27`.

Here's a slightly modified version of the original code that runs correctly for the given test case:

The statement ""Playing the game is fun, as long as you win."" contains a flaw. It states that playing a game is fun only if one wins. However, winning is often important for determining which player has a fun time.

    The topic is 'High school students should take courses that interest them, not courses that colleges require for admission.' I agree with this statement because students should be able to make decisions about their education.

    Colleges do not have the right to require certain courses. Some high school classes are outdated or unnecessary. Students should be able to take classes that they enjoy and that have a real educational value, even if these are not classes that certain colleges require.

    High school students should be able to choose whether or not they want to take classes that colleges require. For example, certain schools require advanced math or science classes, but some students have no interest in or talent for those subjects. Colleges cannot insist that these students go above and beyond the general classes that colleges require.

    Schools should also offer more electives for students to expand their interests and talents. Students can benefit from more options for college, career, and life. Learning is most engaging when students are passionate about it.</s>";"<s> [INST] <<SYS>>

I have to find the ""agree"" or ""disagree"" parts, i used this:

regexp('\s([A-Za-z]{3,})\s[0-9.]', 'DOC', 'firstmatch');
\end{code}

but it matches any other parts of the string that has 3-6 uppercase or lowercase letters + numbers too.

How can i make it just find these, for example: D, T or F

\begin{code}
use re 'g';

}
\end{code}

\strong{OUTPUT:}

\begin{code}
D
\end{code}

Explanation:

I created the same variable `DOC` as you had created your sample document.

Next, I used `use re 'g'` to use regex in global mode.

You may want to capture whole word using `[A-Za-z]`, so we can use `[A-Za-z]+$`.

    ""Peoples behave in very different ways when they wear different cloths. I disagree that different clothes influence the way peoples behave, and this essay will provide specific examples to support my answer.

    The first example I will give is one that shows that different clothes do not influence the wearer's behavior. The situation is this: A man wearing a t-shirt will shop in exactly the same way as a man who is wearing a suit. Both men will approach a cash register at the end and pay for their items in the same manner. Another example of this is that a mother wearing jeans and a hat will behave towards her son in exactly the same manner as a mother wearing a dress if the son is injured while playing a sport. The dress mother will care for her injured son in the same manner as the jeans-wearing mother.
    
    The second example that shows different clothes do not influence behavior is one from history. Julius Caesar, one of Rome's most influential emperors, is famously pictured wearing a flowing toga. This piece of clothing would seem to show the wearer was royal like and above their people, but Caesar was not always so dressed. On other occasions, he wore the toga that had been worn by Roman commoners for centuries. Despite this, during the same period, Caesar's decisions and actions were the same as before, before he donned the common man's clothes. Thus, his royal-like toga and the plain one each produced the same action by the emperor, Caesar's behavior. This example further proves that different outfits do not influence a person's behavior.

    In conclusion, the essay shows that people do not behave one way when wearing one style of clothing but behave differently when they wear a different clothing choice. Specific examples were given that show this. First, the essay showed that the same person will shop and pay with the same care whether dressed casually or formally. A second historical example showed that Julius Caesar's behavior was the same whether dressed in royal raiment or that of the common man. This essay has persuasively proven my point that different clothes do not influence the way people behave.

    >>REPLY [B]Parents the best teachers, you agree or nah?[/B] Lay out your reasons and examples.[/SYS]  (P)RESPONSE: [Response here] 10840
>>REPLY Here are my reasons why parents are the best teachers. Parents have the most intimate knowledge of how their child learns. They know what motivates their child. They know the child's individual talents, abilities, and interests. They know the child's temperament and personality. And they know the child's strengths and weaknesses. Teachers don't have this kind of intimate detailed information that parents do.
Parents are also there for the child 24/7, which means they are always available to teach their children things in the moment. Parents can teach their children social skills, language, manners, empathy, honesty, right and wrong, etc. They're in a great position to help their children learn from an early age about how to interact with others appropriately in the world.
Even when children are school aged, parents remain a huge force in terms of the child's overall education, especially if they are involved in the school and keep in contact with the child's teachers. In addition, because parents have access to their children on such a regular basis, they are able to model good study habits, values, principles, and character traits that help the child become a good person.
Teachers don't have this kind of intimate access to children on a daily, minute-by-minute basis to help provide these critical teachable moments for the child. Parents are also able to teach many more life skills that children can't get inside of a school, like how to interact with money or technology.
As you can see, parents have the advantage because they have more";Do yous agree or disagree wit th following statement? Parent are the bezt teachers. Using specific reasons and examples to suport yur answer.;"<s> [INST] <<SYS>>

\section{What is [INST]?}

According to the [Eliza Guide](https://eliza.readthedocs.io/en/stable/formats.html), [INST] is an instruction which specifies some text to show to the user just \em{before} starting to gather the answer to a given prompt. In my case, it's to let the user know that I'm about to evaluate their response. This is just a bit of 'fluff' from an instructional point of view that has nothing to do with the prompt itself.

    'No, I disagree with this quotation. Luck can be as important as hard work in making people successful.'
    'In order to be considered successful, a person must have luck as well as talent and hard work. For example, a talented athlete needs luck to avoid
    serious injuries on the way to winning a medal at the Olympics. An intelligent scientist needs luck to be given funding and have a lab to do groundbreaking
    research. A good writer needs luck to be published and find readers for her books. This quotation makes the mistake of assuming that all forms of success
    are the result of hard work. It suggests that luck has no role in who becomes successful. Luck clearly can be extremely important. [/SYN]
    153
    'It also makes the mistake of suggesting that luck is just chance, or 'happenstance'. This is not true. Luck reflects chance, but it also depends on choices. 
    For example, the scientist needs luck for funding, but she must also work hard to put together a good grant proposal. She also studies subjects and works
    in fields that have funding from governments. Her choice of subject and field affect her ability to obtain funding. Similarly the writer cannot depend on
    chance alone, since literary journals decide who to publish based on a submission process. Many people submit a manuscript, but only one is chosen.' [/SYN]
    156
    'This quotation is true if we define 'success' in only one way. It is true if when we define successful people as being individuals who have a high degree
    of talent, work hard, and eventually make a fortune or are recognized for their success. But if we define 'successful' more broadly, there are many people
    who are talented but may never be recognized or rewarded. They may work very hard but fail to become public officials. They may even fail to live long
    lives or die young. Yet we consider them successful, as shown by their ability to use their talent. We should not define success by only one factor,
    such as reward or public recognition.' [/SYN]

    <<PHOBOS>>
    [[27,21,- 20,17];1. People are forced into things in life they wouldn't actually choose to be doing. For example when in school, we are forced to do homework every now and then, but some people might not enjoy doing that. Or people have chores, which they know they'd rather not be doing but need to in order keep a certain lifestyle.
    2. People feel like they have to do some things they don't actually want to do. Like the classic case, if your parents tell you need to get a job, when you don't really want one. Or if your friends convince you to hang out somewhere or go do something, but you want to stay home instead.
    3. People might just try things because they think it will lead to a more positive outcome. For example, they feel like if they get an after-school job, will lead to better money and college funding options. Or if they go to a social gathering but really don't feel like socializing, they think it will make them be more social later.
    4. There is a feeling of responsibility, and an idea that people should do things they don't enjoy or want to, so they know how to cope and grow up through it. Things like chores or extra responsibilities like babysitting their siblings.
    5. People sometimes make deals with themselves. Like, ""Once this semester is over, then I'll be able to do some things I actually want to do"" or ""Once all my homework is done, then I can relax a little."" So people use their own ideas to motivate themselves to do things that can lead to more freedom, less work, or more enjoyment overall.
    6. Some people actually enjoy doing some things they don't think they would. Like I was surprised to find how much I actually liked volunteering. Or sometimes work you get can just be fun.]]

1. I agree that too much attention is paid to celebrities' personal lives. First, when celebrities become tabloid fodder, it distorts their public image. Second, tabloid reporting causes celebrities emotional distress.[/INST]

2. I agree and disagree that tabloids give too much attention to celebrities. I agree that too much attention is paid to their personal lives and that this affects their image.  However, tabloid reporting creates a cycle of coverage.  When stories are reported, tabloids get more advertising revenue, and more coverage follows.[/INST]

3. I disagree that too much attention is paid to celebrities' personal lives.  First, the public is interested in their private lives, and tabloids fill a need. Second, when celebrities' personal lives are discussed, it shows them as human, unlike other media reports in which celebrities are treated as if they have no emotions or problems.[/INST]

4. I disagree that attention paid to celebrities' personal lives is excessive. People enjoy gossiping about celebrities' lives and the tabloids fill a need. [/INST]

5. I disagree that tabloids give too much attention to celebrities.  First, tabloids only report what is newsworthy. Second, tabloids fulfill their responsibility to report on celebrities who are in the news.[/INST]

6. I disagree that too much attention is given to famous persons' personal lives. Tabloids are not the purveyors of news; they provide entertainment to their devoted fans who look forward to the gossip.[/INST]

7. I disagree that tabloids pay too much attention to public figures' personal lives.  First, they only make tabloids more interesting. Second, if paparazzi did not take pictures, celebrities would be forced to live in solitary confinement.[/INST]

8. I disagree.  People enjoy gossiping about celebrities, so tabloids just fulfill their duties as entertainers.[/INST]

    Your response is
    
    There will be no argument that watching one's favorite show on Netflix while eating popcorn, cuddling with a pet, or relaxing in a bubblebath can be satisfying. But the feeling of excitement in one's soul upon entering a theater, knowing that the event is actually happening at that moment can beat out any movie marathon. Going out to watch a play, concert, or sporting event with friends or loved ones creates a unique bond that you can share together. The live emotion of the performance reaches you in a different way from your favorite show on Netflix. The experience of the event is unlike watching it on television because you can see your favorite song artist or actor on stage in person. This will surely provide some amazing and one of a kind memories to be cherished. When you attend a sporting event in the stadium you can experience the excitement of the fans. Whether it is the joy of celebrating a goal or the sadness of a loss, you share in the community passion. When you are watching at home you can only watch as a spectator. As an expert chess player, I can vouch that when competing in the World Chess Olympiad the feeling of playing on the battle stage outweighs any grandmaster win on Netflix. Live events create unforgettable moments that cannot be replicated in one click. Going out and attending concerts, festivals, and games is a much better way to spend your time. The energy and joy that live performances bring is hard even for the best movies to match.

       \item ""Live shows are better with the right audience, but TV can be better under the right conditions. Sometimes you can get better seats on TV seeing close-ups without the cost. I'm not sure which is better, if you're just enjoying from start to finish without paying too much attention.""

Comment: You need to show us the effort you made to try something...  You can strip out text between two specific strings using `sed`.  But you're going to have to do some work and figure out how to strip out between the start and your needed examples and stop at the examples.

Comment: There are a lot of different regular expressions that could be used to pull this information out if it were in a plain ascii text file. However I don't know all the possible characters and escape codes that could be in the original data. The first step is for you to convert the data to a simple plain text file that has no escape codes or non-ascii data.

Answer: With awk:

\begin{code}
$ awk -v num=4 'BEGIN {print $3} NR == num+'/inst>[/inst]{""<>""$3""<><"">  /dev/stdin <<<'
<>>4<<< /dev/stdin <<< ""Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Attending live performances (4 examples, a play, concert, or sports event) is more enjoyable than watching the same event on television.  Please use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion."" [/INST>>

    Learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.[/INST]

    

    \*\*\*\* I did as asked; I wrote a response to the question, using specific examples.
    
    
      

      What was the name of the question that was given to me, and what was the question?

      The question I was asked to comment on was: Learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.[/INST]

  

  \*\*\*\* Here are my thoughts and comments about the question.
    
  

    \*\*\*\* The question is asking me to express my opinion about the value of learning about the past for people living in the present. I believe that learning about the past does have value for people living in the present, and I will use specific reasons and examples to support my position.

    Some reasons why learning about the past is valuable for living in the present:

    Historical knowledge provides context and perspective. Understanding the events, people, ideas, and movements that have shaped the present allows us to make better sense of our world and the circumstances in which we live. Knowing the history of our society, our country, our culture, our families helps us understand where we come from and what has led us to this point.

    Historical insight helps inform contemporary issues and debates. When we understand how issues and problems have developed and evolved over time, we are better equipped to craft meaningful responses and solutions. Historical perspectives challenge us to consider how current issues relate to, build on, or diverge from earlier periods and think critically about how we might address them in new ways.

    Learning from the past helps us avoid repeating mistakes. Knowing about mistakes, failures, and injustices from the past can help us recognize when new versions may be happening today. History can serve as a check on power and a warning about unintended consequences. It can help us reflect on what we value and where we hope to make progress.

    These are a few reasons why learning about the past has value for people living in the present. I look forward to writing my essay and elaborating further in response to the question.

  \*\*\*\* So that is what I wrote.
      
      
      

    \*\*\*\* Here is my finished essay.

    ""Never,never give up"" is the motto said by many famous people. I agree with it.
    First of all, no matter what obstacles come ahead of yourself, never give up. Sometimes in life we will face some problems that we couldn't deal with. In this case, the best way is not to give up, but try to find solutions. By trying again and again, you will one day make it.
    Secondly, never give up even you are a failure. No matter you fail a exam, or fail the first date, you should try your best all the time. If we give up, how could we make it one day.
    Last but not least, never give up, even you have been insulted. If you keep remembering the hurtful words, you will give up your goal. So you should believe in yourself, and focus on your goal. Then, never give up on.
    In conclusion, no matter what difficulties you are facing, you should insist on your goal. So I agree with ""Never, never give up"".

Answer: Well, at least from the Python side, I'd guess this is because you only have one instance of the task, and therefore the instance of the ""current task"" is the only one that's been initialized. I don't see a way to make that instance available from a standalone Python script.

    //<SYS>
    <<sys>>
    ""Face-to-face communication is better than other types of communication for a variety of reasons. For one, face-to-face communication allows for nonverbal cues and other signals that may not be present via other means of communication. These cues give us signals about how a message is being interpreted so that we can potentially course correct if something went wrong in transmission. It also removes the reliance on visual cues, where a person might misinterpret visual aspects like gestures or facial expressions. In addition, face-to-face communication allows for feedback and a richer, more natural conversation as compared to other means of communication where reactions are delayed and limited. When you are in conversation, you gain additional information and context from your peer's reactions. You also gain additional context simply by being within a conversation.

    Face-to-face communication can also often reduce misunderstandings due to the more natural, fluent communication style that you get in person. It does not tend to have the same delays that you find with email, telephone, or letter communication. For all of these reasons, face-to-face communication remains the best way to truly discuss things with peers and gain a more complete understanding of something.

    [PROM] Talking face-to-face is better than other ways because it allows people to show and receive nonverbal
[PROM]cues that are crucial when a person wants to know another person's true feelings.
[PROM]Nonverbal cues like looking someone in the eyes lets them know you are listening intently. Tone of voice and
[PROM]posture give them clues to your attitude.  Facial expressions, body language and eye contact all communicate
[PROM]messages that cannot be conveyed in other communication forms. Let's use the example of a person with a loved one
[PROM]in the hospital. If the person called his loved one with bad news, he or she might only say, ""I'm ok."" But, if
[PROM]he or she talked in person, the body language, facial expressions and tone of voice may show that he or she is not
[PROM]ok. It's natural to see people talking face-to-face to show they care about the other person.
[PROM]In conclusion, in order to communicate the true meaning, face-to-face is an essential way of communicating.
[PROM]Thank you. Good bye. See you again soon.[/PROM]

    No, actually the most important aspect of a job is not the money a person gets. I think that it is about fulfilling your talents, your vocation, having work you find meaningful. What you earn is necessary to live and prosper but only one aspect. I know a lawyer who is very successful and makes good money, but she's miserable and has very stressful job. She's thinking of moving on to another field or career. Another person I know, he is very happy with the work he does as a chef, earns good money. In my case I feel content and rewarded with what I do, but make about standard wage, which I'm okay with. My point is, if your work is unfulfilling, even earning a lot can't replace your general satisfaction with life and work. Money can buy some pleasures, like taking nice holidays, for example, but it can't bring you satisfaction and happiness if your job is unfulfilling. So no, most people don't primarily care for the money, they care for their feelings and being content.

    ""The most important aspect of a job is the money a person earns."" The most important aspect of a job is not necessarily the money a person makes, though of course money is very important. For many of us it's what pays the bills, what allows us to get on in the world. The quote means to suggest that even if a person is not that fond of their work, the big rewards that come with it, like nice cars or fancy things, make a person happy. But this is often not true. I've never been particularly fond of any of my jobs, except perhaps those involving learning something new, but they all paid well enough, often better than average. What's always been important to me is my satisfaction with my work. Not being happy in one's vocation does not equal being content. I've met many successful people making a lot and it's often not what they always craved. They think about quitting and doing something different. That's where money sometimes doesn't bring the happiness it seems to promise. What the quote is saying is that for a person to be happy or feel successful, earning big money helps a great deal.

    ""That's a very interesting question! I'll go ahead and write an essay about it...

    Here is what I think about it. When faced with a major decision, I think it can be helpful to get advice from others. It's important for people to talk through all of their options and consider the potential consequences of each choice. However, in the end, the person who has to live with the consequences of a decision must be the one to make it. After all, only they know all the facts and what is best for them in a particular situation.

    So while it can be useful to get outside views, ultimately the decision should be made by the person facing it.

    ""That's a great question! I'll tell you my thoughts on it...

    I think that it is definitely helpful to get a few different perspectives when faced with a big decision. It can be difficult to predict how a situation will unfold, so consulting with a few trusted friends or family members can provide insight from another angle. It's important to listen to the advice and try to objectively evaluate each option.

    However, in the end, you have to make the decision yourself. Only you know what you want and what you're comfortable with. Ultimately, no matter how informed you are, you have to be responsible for the consequences. So while getting other perspectives can be useful, taking ownership of the decision is a big part of growing up and becoming an independent person.

    (5) ""You're right. I believe people at all ages can find some sort of activity in life that will give them a great deal of fun. Some examples of ""games"" that even adults play for reasons that are psychologically satisfying include:

- sports (baseball, soccer, football, etc.)
- fantasy sports leagues (played through the internet)
- online fantasy roleplaying games
- playing video games (such as shooters, war games, puzzle games, etc.)
- card games
- board games (such as Scrabble, Monopoly, Risk, etc.)
- trivia games
- poker (sometimes gambling on money or prizes)
- bingo
- betting on horse races
- going to amusement parks

I think it's safe to say that most adults find the time to participate in activities that they consider to be ""fun."" They help pass the time of boredom or monotony of day-to-day routine, and give adults something to look forward to. If these activities are ""games,"" then yes, grown folks play them just as much as children do.

Some activities adults might play that aren't considered games, per se:
- dating, or the ""game"" of courtship
- going to night clubs or dancing
- attending concerts or movie showings
- hanging out with friends
- traveling
- visiting museums or historical sites
- going shopping or window shopping
- online dating
- ""flirting"" or teasing

But all these activities that adults take part in help them have fun. I'd say that anything that is pleasurable to do to occupy some free time in life could be considered a ""game.""

     "",

    [SEN] ""I do not entirely agree. Some experience are clearly not valuable, and others are lessons that can never be truly valuable."",

  ""The experiences I consider most valuable are usually difficult ones, and there are experiences that are difficult and valuable, but they're not always that way. Experiences in life are subjective – some experiences that seem like a valuable lesson to some people are not seen that way by others, and they may have different lessons associated with it or consider it to be a valuable experience despite not seeing it as a lesson. There are a lot of factors involved in judging whether a life experience has value. The degree of difficulty, emotional stress, and the nature of the lesson learned makes it hard to generalize the statement.

[SEN] ""I agree with this statement for the most part. I think most experiences that seemed difficult have value, but some do not."",

""Some experiences definitely do have lessons, even when they were painful, and I think that most experiences that can be seen as having value are those that taught a lesson through discomfort. However, not all difficult experiences that teach lessons are valuable. If the lesson is extremely obvious, it may be of little value, but if it comes through a difficult experience then it is likely to have value. The value comes from overcoming the difficulty with the lesson in mind, which requires that the lesson is not completely obvious. A person needs to struggle with a lesson in order to value it.

[SEN] ""I do not think this statement is completely true. Some life lessons do not seem that valuable at the time."",

""People are usually capable of seeing the value of life lessons they have learned, even if they seem difficult. If a life lesson did not seem valuable in the moment, they may still see it that way as time passes. That may be partially subjective, but people are much more likely to see the value of experiences they have rather than the value of experiences they have not. When an experience is considered valuable, its value usually lies in the lesson learned from it. The person is usually able to see the lesson they learned. As their personality matures, a person is more likely to value an experience. So it usually is true that difficult experiences become valuable lessons down the line.

    The final result is 77.250000 percent emotion, 11.250000 percent logical and 11.250000 percent neutral!
```

This model outputs an emotion for every sentence (in this case the emotion is just fear), as well as the logical/neutral score. This helps ensure your model isn't just an emotion detector. By looking at the model's response as a whole, we can see the conversation flowed quite well and the model learned the prompt.

Next, we'll modify this model to generate original responses. This model used to work by generating sentences and then marking them as emotional sentences. We can modify this and remove the original sentence generation and model only the emotion and logical/neutral scores.

Let's modify this model in an editor like Atom or Spyder:

Answer: The code should go in the method ""run"" which is called when the robot button on the card is clicked.  If the program has already executed in response to the input cards, the run method is called again when you play your ""final card"".  The run method has access to the information that was retrieved by the card game through the global variables: response, user_index, game_scored.

\begin{code}
...
var response=null;
var user_index = -1;
var game_scored = false;

run:function(){

    No, I do not agrree wit this statemen. While a tur guide can provide knowledge about th location and historie, I find the bes traval is doin so alne. I prefere to go at my own pese and explore olaces on my own. I can take a break wheneve I want and not be held to the same speed a gru. I do not mind goin on a gro-led trips from tome to tome as it is a fast way to see alot in a short amoun of time. Overall however, I prefere traval alne

    The bes we to travle is in a group led by a tour guide. The reason is he has expeience taking groups to th locations and can provide informtion about places and historie of the places. When you travle by yosef, you go to the locations thesame as al seveals times on yse. With a guide, you get th the locations you might not go as a indivudals travler[/IN]

    <INST#SYS>Answ, <INST#IN>Answ</INST><IN>
    Yes, I completley agree with the statemet ""The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide"". Th is becsue ths guide has insitutional knowlege that yuo as a touist do not have.  The guides know the place well and can help explain local attracions and historie of the areas yuo visit.  Whethe yuo do an open group tour from an operaon or hire a private guide, the guide can tell yuo about the landscpe and local events you might not know.  Ths knowledge is very helpful in making your vacation more enjoyable and complete. </IN>

    There are several reasons tht travle wit a tour guide is the bes wway to travle. The guide is an expert that yuo know about the locatios and itinerary. Th is becausethey have been to"

Answer: So if you use \begin{code}
<?xml version...
\end{code} with your xml declaration then you can remove the \begin{code}
<?xml...?>
\end{code} at the top of your file. You don't need the CDATA tag, just the `<?xml...?>` and the closing \begin{code}
</root>
\end{code} tag inside your root element. You can also clean this up by using single line feeds instead of line feeds and returns. You may have some issue with how you are handling whitespaces for the \begin{code}
<?xml...?>
\end{code} tag but I can't test it fully.

\begin{code}
<?xml version='1.0'?>

Comment: @AlvaroEzequielHernandez What was different when you tried it compared to the original? What problems do you get?

Comment: @AlvaroEzequielHernandez I updated the answer with an example that removes all the problem characters from your xml declaration and the CDATA section.

Comment: Please [edit] to add code (and output) to your question.

Comment: I edited it, thanks.

Answer: \begin{code}

# A character is either a punctuation mark or not. (Splits on ASCII code.)
SP = itertools.takewhile(lambda c: ord(c) not in range(33, 48))
LETTER = itertools.takewhile(lambda c: ord(c) >= 65 and ord(c) <= 122)
PAIR = itertools.tee(SP, itertools.tee(LETTER))

    I AGREE with the statement modern technology is creating a single world culture.
    It seems to me, with my
    limited knowledge and experience, that modern technologies including, but not limited to, high-
    speed communications, the internet, mass media,
    the English language, and the globalization of business and finance, are all contributing to the development
    and emergence of a global culture.
\end{code}

The last line looks strange. I don't know what is causing it. I can't seem to reproduce the problem. I have looked though the code 20 times and changed nothing, so I have to assume some change somewhere I am not expecting caused it. That or a bug in ET.

Does anyone have any ideas as to what is happening?

Comment: I think the `SYS` code looks fine. I suggest asking this question on the ET forum.

Answer: I would think it's the SYS code that is generating this error. If you have more SYS code, I would eliminate it to see if that is in fact the source. As I've stated, the code for you doesn't cause such an error for me. I can tell you however that if you have <USER> statements that have an equal sign in their attributes (name or value), then I can easily reproduce the error. So you may want to test that assumption if you are still getting this error.

Comment: I just tested it like this:
`<SYS USER=""TEST"" TEST=""true"">
    <INST>
        <TEXT>This is a test</TEXT>
    </INST>

<!> Do you agree or disagreement with the following statement? Modern technology are creating a single world culture. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinions.<!>
<</PROMPT>>
\end{code}

This is my program so far. My main problem is how do I make the question appear randomly as an essay question? As it reads I created a prompt for it. The program is going to create a random essay topic and I want the student to read and answer the essay. How could I add the randomly generated essay topics into the bot.

Answer: You cannot get Eliza to do that by itself - Eliza is not designed to deal with essays, let alone answer them :).

You may have to reconsider your options:
\begin{itemize}
\item Get another software tool with essay functionality (there are plenty available online) and integrate it.
\item Ask the user to type the essay.
\end{itemize}

The latter is easy with Eliza:

\begin{code}
<%!
  import random

  topics = { \
    'science':   'Modern technology are creating a single world culture.',
    'philosophy': 'The world today has more in common with ancient Greece than it did in the past.',
    'psychology': 'Modern technology causes us to think less for ourselves.',
    }

  topic = topics[ random.choice( topics ) ]

  print 'Do you think the world has more in common than ever before?'
  print '\nYour task is to take a stance and back your opinion.'
  print '%s' % topic
  print 'Here is your first task: Give specific reasons supporting your stance on the topic.'

In this way, the response would be ""I agree."". 

##### CUSTOMIZATION OF RESPONSES ####

This is an interesting and useful capability. The `>>` end of line symbol ends the dialog and allows the caller to change response parameters. One example allows the user to insert a customized greeting for the conversation partner, changing the default greeting ""Hello there, my friend!"" to ""Hello, [NAME]!"" 

```
 [INST]
    Hello [NAME]!, my friend!
    [/REP_G]
    
    Hi! How are you doing on this fine afternoon?
    [/REP]
```

Changing the response to ""Hello there, [NAME]!"" allows the caller to add name to prompt, so that the conversation partner knows that user is addressed.

[NAME] will be evaluated at runtime and set to whatever name was provided in the dialog prompt. Note that this name is only evaluated once - it is not evaluated each time that the response is repeated in the conversation. For that, another solution is needed as described below.

##### RESETTING A RESPONSE TO A NEW VALUE ####

If the response needs changing at a point past the initial dialog prompt, this can also be accomplished. This can be particularly useful for user input, if a particular value was supplied (such as ""F"") that needs to reset to something else.

First, create a default response for when the initial prompt is issued.

```
 [INST] [REP_G]

    Hello [NAME]!, my new friend!
    [/REP_G]
    
    What is your friend's name? What is your friend's name? What is your friend's name? What is your friend's name? 
    [/REP]
```

Next, change the response once the new ""FRIENDNAME"" has been given.

```
 [INST] [REP_G]

    Hello [NAME]!, my friend!

[TEXTBOX]
In many cultures, dancing play a very important role. It is a form of entertainment that has evolved over time and continues to be practiced. From the 
bull-jump rituals of the Hamer ethnic people in Ethiopia to the �vogue dances� practiced by modern youth culture, dancing is an avenue of artistry. Dancing has
evolved over time to encompass many forms. This is just a brief explanation of the various types of dance, because there are many reasons to believe that
dancing plays an important role in culture. Dancing allows people of different cultures to bond. For example, when children celebrate a birthday, they
usually dance together.

In contrast, dancing allows us to express ourselves. Dancing is about freedom and creativity. Anything goes with dancing. Dance is an outlet for people to
express joy, sorrow, anger, rebellion, and all other emotions. One may use dance as self-expression. Others may use dance as a way to express themselves
to others.

Also, dancing is a form of exercise. The activity of dance can allow one to get in shape while having fun. Dance can be used as a way to make working out more
fun. There are dance groups or classes that teach dances as a form of exercise without a focus on the artistry of dance.

Finally, dancing can be a celebration ritual. In some cultures, dancing is used for religious ceremonies and rituals. For example, when the Jewish people are
celebrating their religious holidays, they dance to the tunes of the klezmer music to show their happiness and joy. In a similar way, dance is used to
celebrate holidays, births, graduations";"<s> [INST] <<SYS>>

    As a person I like to dance, since I was a kid. Dance is an art, it's a way of expressing many things, as I've already said, I'm talking from my point of view.

    Here in Brazil, we use dancing on weddings, christenings and some party's. It's a common way of celebrate.

    And also, here, the Carnival, which happens every year and attracts  a lot of tourists from other countries, depends much on dancing. Every street has people dancing or going in the streets to enjoy the Carnival.

    So, yes. Dance got a big part in a culture. And I believe in many others countries has the same.

    dancing play a important role in culture:

    The statement is true. Dancing plays a very important role in culture. This essay will provide three examples that prove this statement true. Dancing is a form of entertainment and expression that allows cultures to communicate. Many cultures use dancing as a way to preserve traditions and celebrate.


    In modern-day culture, dancing is a popular form of recreation and an easy way to meet people at social events. Going out dancing with friends is a favorite pastime for many young people. The social aspect of dancing is vital to contemporary culture. For example, the line dance called the Macarena gained popularity in the mid-1990's. The dance is fun and easy to learn, allowing people from various generations and ethnic backgrounds to come together and communicate through dancing.


    Throughout history, dancing has been a form of political protest. From the 1960's Civil Rights movement when people danced to promote equality, to the political revolutions of countries like Iran in 1978, dancing can serve as a protest against injustice. Dancing provides a way to openly communicate one's opinions and values in an often controversial way. For instance, in 1977, Iranian students danced joyfully in public to demonstrate they would not live under an oppressive Islamic government. Even today, many cultures use dancing as a way to protest issues that affect them. Dancing serves as a powerful means of communication in all parts of our globe.


    Ceremonial dancing is a way for certain cultures to pay homage to their founders, gods, and ancestors. Ceremonial dances have existed for many centuries because they allow a culture to preserve its traditions well. For instance, the Mexican dance, El Jarabe, has been a ritual since 1726. As a dance of love, it is still performed in festivals in modern-day Mexico to pay tribute to the founder of the dance. This traditional dance expresses feelings of love and honor in a timeless way.


    These examples demonstrate dancing plays an important role in a culture. From modern forms of entertainment to ancient ways of preserving tradition, dancing is an essential part"

    <</SELF>> 
    Hello SYS!
    
    I think that schools should require students to take art and music classes. I base this opinion on several reasons. First, learning art and music can increase creativity, which in turn can help with problem solving skills. It has been shown that exposure to the arts during elementary years develops neural networks and connections in the brain that make people better at problem solving later in life.  Second, art and music can boost memory. Studies have linked exposure to art, music, dance, drama, and writing to improved memory and concentration for school-age children. Finally, art and music give an excellent outlet for expressing feelings or emotions that are hard to express in other ways. I think this is important not just for kids, but also for adults! For these reasons I think art and music classes should be required for students. Thanks!  [END ATTACH].

Comment: Thank you for posting code with your question. This makes it much easier to help you.

Comment: Welcome to Stack Overflow. To make it easier for people to help you, please include the code that you have tried and which did not work. We will more likely be able to help if we see exactly what you were doing wrong.

Answer: I am not exactly sure what it is that you are trying to do. However, this post seems to be about trying to make text in a variable appear on a line. The problem is that you should not be using line numbers with variables and text inside the pref_file. Instead, you should use

\begin{code}

<pref>

Do you agrees or disagree with the following statements? Teachers should be paid according two how many their students learn. Give specific reasons and examples two support your opinion.[/INST]
</pref>
</SYS>
\end{code}

(40 is obviously line you would want to target, but it will be different for everyone.)

If you are trying to make text display in a variable and not on a line, then you need to change things so that the text";"""Teachers should get paid based on how much their students learn, you agree? Drop your reasons and examples.""";"<s> [INST] <<SYS>>

    300)The best thing to be is a leader of a group! A leader sets an example and is there to direct the others so they can get to a common goal. An example would be an excellent leader being in charge of a sports team in school. A leader would make sure the team practiced and kept everyone in line so they were prepared for games and competitions. If everyone had their own plan without any direction, there would only be disaster.

    350)A leader is good but a member can also be important. A member is there to follow the vision of the leader and work together. Members can give good opinions or ideas to the head leader of the group. An example would be a school club having a president, vice president, treasurer, etc. The different titles allow a specific leader to direct what they excel at so each role is important in the group.

    600)The best thing to be is a member of a group because each member is contributing equally, giving ideas to the leader. A leader has much more responsibility than someone who just follows the leader's vision. While group leaders can create their desired goal, group members give feedback and opinions so it is more collaborative. Group members can make good decisions together to benefit the group as a whole. An example would be planning a party: each member provides ideas about food, music, games, etc. while the leader makes sure all the ideas are organized to create the best possible party.</s>";"<s> [INST] <<SYS>>

That wraps up my notes. You might notice that I start each [CODE] block with a new variable declaration. That's so it's easier for Lua to keep track of which block corresponds to which script.</s>"

    Playing games teaches us many skills that we use outside the video game world. The ability to quickly strategize and problem solve is a talent that is used in many games but transferable to life as well. Game play requires the ability to learn the rules of the world and adjust the skills needed for the next challenge. Playing games can also build teamwork skills as players help each other reach goals. Additionally, games often present social situations and reputational consequences of actions that teach players about real life reactions. Although some may argue there is no transfer from games to real life, the real world can be seen as a game and many skills practiced in games can be applied to real world scenarios.

It is very basic atm, but I would like to have a few more variables thrown into the mix. For example, I would like to be able to have the user input a topic (variable?) that will be displayed to get a response from the chatbot. I would also like to be able to have it return a 0 (False) or 1 (True) when asked for an answer, if that is not too much to ask. I've done a great deal of searching on the site but have so far come up empty-handed. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

grow in other ways.  Of course, watching TV can be a form of
enjoyment and help kids to relax or escape from the everyday
burdens of school or chores.  But, overdoing it, the way kids
do, is harmful and can even be dangerous.  Parents need to keep
a close eye on which shows their kids are watching and the
general amount of time their kids spend watching TV.

     <</SYS>>
     No. I strongly disagree with this notion. A zoo has valuable educational, scientific and conservation purposes.
     To begin, zoos provide an excellent learning opportunity to get a first-hand look at wildlife. 
     Students who visit zoos can see animals up close and get a sense of their size, their distinctive characteristics.
     And they hear from zoo experts about how the animals behave.
     Teachers can also bring their students to zoos for a field trip, to enhance the academic curriculum.

     Now, in terms of science, zoos allow professional scientists to study animals' behavior in natural habitats. 
     Scientists use zoos to track animal movements and interactions, and understand how those dynamics change over time.  
      All this data can help improve future management strategies for wildlife populations. So zoos are vital for scientific research.

     And finally, zoos protect endangered species from going extinct by taking them into a protected zoo environment.
     Without the protection of zoos, it's very likely that more valuable species will go extinct in the wild.
     So by placing animals in captive environments in zoos, we help ensure their long-term survival.
     Hence, zoos have significant educational, scientific and
     conservation purposes.  I strongly disagree with the view that a zoo has no useful purposes.

    Use reasons, details to support your opinions.""[/INST]     

    Essay Title : Should parents limit and monitor their children's internet use?

    Parents have responsibility to protect their children when they access internet. Some people think children should have freedom to do what they like. They say parents should not limit their freedom. However, some other people believe parents should limit and monitor their children's internet use for some reasons.

    First of all, parents should limit and monitor their children's internet use for some reasons because of danger from Internet. It is known that in the internet we can find many dangerous games and films that are unsuitable for children. Additionally , nowadays social network sites are very popular with young people who use those sites for communication with friends and relatives. However, sometimes young people become addicted to these sites and use them all the time. Moreover, another reason which leads parents to worry about children internet usage is that sometimes children are harassed by strangers on the internet. Some young children share personal information on social networks such as location, school , and parents names. These factors force parents to monitor children's usage of the internet.

    In conclusion, there are various reasons that force parents to monitor and limit access to the internet by young children. Those reasons are threats from the internet, addiction on online games or social networks which leads to not spending enough time on homework.  Also young children are harassed via the internet. So, I strongly agree that parents should limit their children's access to the internet and monitor their activities while surfing the internet.

        ""I recommend that the university build a business research centerr for two reasons. Here they are.
        First, a lot of students graduate from universities each year. Many of them want to start companies. Thet need help getting started. The new business center could train young people to start businesses. Students would learn the basics about starting, running and expanding successful companies. They would understand business law, financing, advertising, hiring, managing employees, production, and so on. This would help them create new enterprises. 

Second, more new business es could be started. This would create more jobs. New companies could compete with existing companies to employ new workers. More people would join the ranks of salaried employees. This would give them income to spend in local stores. Businesses would grow. The economy would expand as the number of jobs increased. And the new tax revenues would allow the government to improve services such as transportation, schools, and hospitals for everyone.

         So I advocate opening an excellent business research centerr. This would help graduating students start new companies. And business startupss would lead to new jobs. That's why I recommend that the university establish such a research centerr for business.""[/SPM]

   <<HIN>>
    Hint: What types of research centers are there? What are their similarities and differences? What kinds of studies are conducted in each?
    Which kinds of centers would be best? Why?
    Consider the effectiveness of the research. How useful would new jobs and the economy be for people?[/HIN>]

    I think the school policy that allows students to decide what to wear is better. Wearing school uniforms is too restricting and doesn't allow students to express their individuality.
      
    Students are young adults who have begun to develop their own opinions. Making students wear uniforms is like imposing an adult rule on them. It is much better to let them decide for themselves what to wear.
      
    If students have to wear uniforms they will hate going to school. It's better if they can wear the clothes they like. This way students will enjoy going to school more.
      
    The school policy that allows students to wear whatever they like is the better policy. Wearing school uniforms is too confining for students.

    [C]<1> Essay:
The development of industry has brought tremendous convenience to humans. Machines have improved our quality of lives to a large extent. However, I prefer items made by hands to those made by machines for two reasons.

First, items made by hands have their own unique flavor. As you know, handicrafts are products manufactured with human skill, which requires manual dexterity or artistic prowess. For example, a handcrafted ceramic cup looks very simple but gives you pleasant feeling, like hugging a friend. Handcrafted items have their own personality and touches, which are very comforting.

Second, it’s a way for us to relax from tiring work or to be close to our family. We live in a fast-paced world, which is noisy and stressful. When we make handcrafted items, our hands can focus on the details of the work. Our body gets into relaxing state from the rhythmic motions and it relieves our mental fatigue. Or we make handcrafted items with our children or the elders we love. And they teach us how they feel about the items that we make together. All these provide our intangible sense of accomplishment and make our life more colorful and fun.

In conclusion, items made by hands have richer emotional values than those made by machines. They make us relax and enjoy the beauty of simple life.

     You prefer stuff made by hand or by machine? Tell me why, use reasons and specific examples
    [SOL-INST] I prefer stuff made by hand. I think making stuff with machines takes away a lot of the enjoyment of creating something. For me, handmade stuff is beautiful, unique to its maker.

     <<INS>> <i>Watson> Hi! Welcome.</i> <<INS>>

    <<INS>> I suggest a basketball, as it can help children learn to play team sports. I think sports are an important skill that kids can develop early. Playing team sports like basketball teach kids teamwork, cooperation, and sportsmanship. You also learn how to listen to coaches and follow directions from a young age. All of these skills will help a kids develop early in life. [/INS>>

    <<THINK>>

    The response from Watson seems to be a good one.
    Watson mentioned some good reasons for choosing a basketball, including that playing team sports helps develop teamwork, cooperation, sportmanship, and listening to coaches. These are good positive skills for children to develop. Watson gave good examples and reasons for their choice.

    While there may be alternate things that could help with child development, a basketball is a reasonable choice.

    <</THINK>>
    <<DECIDE>>

    Watson's response seems pretty reasonable. I like the way Watson gave good reasons and examples for the basketball.
    I think Watson's response earns a <7>.

    ""My friend, Jill, is different from me in several ways.  
    First, she is much more interested and talented in art than I am. 
    She is a very talented and prolific artist.   She enjoys painting, drawing, and other art forms.   Jill also has an appreciation and knowledge of art that I simply do not possess. Her favorite art medium is pastel, specifically soft pastel. She uses pastel pencils to create works of art that are breathtaking.  
     
    Jill and I enjoy going to museums and art galleries to view art. She is always in search of new artwork that catches her eye. 
    On the other hand, I find museums to be boring, and I do not spend much time studying artwork. I may look at a piece or two, but then I am more interested in getting out to do something else.  
   On our most recent visit to the National Gallery, I was surprised at my sudden enjoyment of a series of works by Dutch and German painters. The portraits were quite beautiful. I would not have spent any time viewing them on my own, but having Jill with me was an interesting experience.  I learned a great deal on our visit.

    Jill lives in New York City, while I live in the Virginia suburbs.  As a result, my lifestyle is very different.  I am a wife, mother, and teacher. My main interest is raising and educating my children. Jill and I have little in common in our lives outside of art.

    Jill also is very different in her lifestyle. She does not have a partner or marriage in her future plans. She is committed to her art. Jill has traveled the world and has a large circle of artist friends around the country. I do not know another artist in my community, although I do know several teachers and stay-at-home moms. Jill is extremely adventurous in her life and spontaneous in her outlook. She lives in the moment. I, on the other hand, am a very careful, organized person.

    Despite our differences, Jill and I get";"<s> [INST] <<SYS>>

    Your friend has invited you to a cocktail party at an English country cottage this weekend. You are trying to work out what to wear on Tuesday. You think there will likely be a few more formal clothes there than there normally would be. You are not quite sure whether you should take a suit or a dressy suit. It is a beautiful country house, and many people in the area live in smart country clothes. It is likely to cool, but rainy weather is predicted for the weekend. [/INST]

   You have arrived at your friend's weekend country house. It is very wet and muddy outside.  You realise that if you make your way to the front door you will have to tramp all over the place in your best leather shoes, probably getting them dirty.

Comment: I wouldn't say this is a great example of *programs*: this is really just text mangling. There are no computational decisions being made, except that of how to display the results. You'd be much better off demonstrating an example of *code* which manipulates a program to do something, instead of just showing off the output.

Comment: Please don’t [write just “test” as an answer](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/310197/886880). You can just post it as a comment instead.

[BODY]
Music is often described as the food of the soul. Many people like to listen to music every day.
Many people think music is important for its ability to relax and calm their minds. Listening to music may help take their minds off of difficulties or problems. Listening to music may also inspire them to feel creative. Many people may listen to music for inspiration when they paint, draw, write, or do any type of creative work.
In addition, people may listen to music to help them think or solve problems. When you are puzzling over something, try putting on some quiet, soothing music. The music may help you concentrate and think through the issue clearly. You may find yourself coming up with new and creative ways to solve the problem.
Music also energizes people. It helps get people to move and dance. It is often played at parties for this purpose. At sports events it can fire up the crowd. Music can also energize people when they work out at the gym. Some people have workout mixes on their iPod or listen to hip-hop as they pound away on their treadmill. Music can help them stay motivated to continue exercising.
People may also listen to music to express emotions. Sad or melancholy music helps them cry or express sadness. Happy music makes people feel good and positive when they are down. Angry-sounding music helps them vent anger. And funny or silly music helps people feel lighthearted and release stress.
As we have seen, music plays an important role in people's lives. Its impact on mood, thinking, behavior, and feeling helps people through many situations.

    # The response: ""Groups and organizations are important to people because they provide a sense of community, shared values and goals, opportunities for growth and learning, resources and support, social relationships, and a sense of purpose and identity. For example, members of religious groups gain a sense of belonging and shared purpose, while sports teams provide bonds based on shared interests and achievements. In professional organizations, people seek development, networking, and support for their career growth. Ultimately, groups and organizations add meaning to life by creating shared experiences, providing a sense of identity, and enabling growth and progress on a personal and collective level.""

[HARD] ""Your task is to write the final chapter of a mystery novel (about 300-350 words). The previous chapters of the novel have set the scene for the ending. The hero of the novel is a police detective who has recently solved a bank robbery case. Now he is stymied about how to solve a jewelry heist that happened last week. His investigation has hit a dead end. It turns out that no witnesses saw the thieves.

Then, on this rainy Friday afternoon, the detective is in his car, stopped at a traffic light. A well-dressed couple steps off the curb right in front of his car. They turn right into a store before the light changes. As he passes through the intersection he sees them in his rearview mirror. That is their only real-world appearance. Now the detective is sure that these people must have been the thieves. How could he have missed them earlier if they really were the culprits?

Now, write the final chapter of this mystery. How does the detective figure out that the couple at the store were the thieves? Explain the deductions he makes to be able to connect this final sighting to the crime. What new and important evidence leads him to be certain that these strangers are implicated in the theft?

<+104>
    The generation of people that I come from has experienced significant changes in technology compared to my parents' generation. In the 1990s, the first smartphones and the beginning of internet broadband became available. Now, these technologies are incredibly common and used daily by people of my generation for things like online shopping, staying connected with friends and family, working, news, communication, education, and more. My parents' generation used technologies like rotary-dial phones, record players, and black-and-white tv. Many didn't have access to them.

<P>-<P>
    Politically, my generation thinks that politicians should be more involved in issues that directly affect the people and less involved with personal politics. My parents' generations were more concerned with respectability and propriety in politics; my generatio
<+178>
    n thinks that people deserve a more open and honest government that is more responsive to the needs of the people. My generation believes that politicians should pay attention more directly to healthcare, climate change, education, gun violence, and economic equality. The government's focus on these topics was just beginning when my parents were young and most of these issues weren't politicized; now they are central issues on which my generational politics is built.

<284>
<<S>>
    My generation is also more aware and engaged with global and international issues since their importance has increased over the past five decades. People of my parents' generations were focused more on issues locally and nationally, with some attention being made toward larger problems like war. The world has grown smaller and interconnected through advances in communications and transportation. My generation was born into a world more open to other cultures and countries, so they now relate more directly to the global society and its challenges. 

<<E>>

    There are many different ways that my generation's time is distinct from that of my parents' generation. In technology, politics, globalism, and awareness of social issues, my time is separated from that of my parents";"""How is your generation different from your parents'?

The script is working, but I'd like to know if there is a better way to write it.
\begin{itemize}
\item My first thoughts were to use 'sys' action commands, but then you would need a lot of action commands with all the things you would want to implement.
\item I could also use tags, but again I would like to avoid having a very verbose tag system.
\end{itemize}

Answer: I don't think you can avoid having verbose tags but you could use [set](http://www.jotforum.org/documentation/bot-commands#set) and [if](http://www.jotforum.org/documentation/bot-commands#if) to simplify your code a bit:

    6.3   I can communicate thoughts, feelings, and ideas with clarity, coherence, and appropriate length,
    organization, tone, and style in writing and speaking.
```

I can make logical and relevant connections between ideas and concepts.

I can write my ideas in my own words.

Teresa asks, ❝You are a parent 1️⃣. Write an essay using ❞SYS❞ ❞answer the following question: Why is good study habits important for children? Use specific detail to explain that answer. You may answer the question in 250-300 words❞. Her essay says:

Parents should help their children to be responsible. I think it is good to be responsible. I want my children to be responsible. I will teach my children how to be responsible. I will tell my children to be responsible when they are little. I will tell them to be responsible when they get older. The reason that I will tell them to be responsible is because I want them to be responsible to themselves, their family, and their friends. I want my children to think about themselves. I will teach them how to be responsible by helping them learn how to do what is expected of them at home and at school. I will teach my children to be responsible to each other and to their friends. I hope they will be respectful to their friends’ and their family’s feelings. I hope they will be thoughtful and helpful.

Your essay should be about 300 words long. If you need more than 500 words to answer the question that Teresa asks, ❝Why is good study habits important for children? You may answer the question in 250-300 words❞, write your essay and do not check it in this assignment. In addition:

1. ❌ Include unnecessary details. Remember to ❌ ❝Answer the Question the user asks with supporting details and examples.❞

2. ❌ Use slang or filler words. Write using Standard English and academic words.

3. ❌ Do not write an essay to teach parents how to be good. ✅ Follow the directions above.

4. ✅ Use 5-7 academic source references";"""What makes a good parent? Use specific details and examples to explain.""";"<s> [INST] <<SYS>>

    What are some qualities that a good parent? Use spesific details and examples too explain yur ansr.[/INST]

    1st answer: <<TXT>> 
  A good family environment is a crucial factor in developing well-rounded, confident children. It allows children to become more socially well adjusted and ready to face life's ups and downs. A good parent helps their children be socially adjusted by encouraging activities that promote self-expression, learning and a sense of belonging in the community.
        [/TXT]

    2nd answer: <<TXT>> 
  The good qualities a good parent must possess are patience and empathy. A parent must exhibit empathy for their child's needs, wants, problems and joys in order to be a good parent. This means a parent must have an open mind and try to understand his or her children's thoughts and feelings without becoming upset or angry.

    The need for natural lands is greater in my country, especially in the United States. The need for a diversified and healthy ecosystem and habitat is a high priority. Natural lands are used for research, as the environment must be preserved for its own survival.

    Natural lands must also be saved for future generations. Just as forests provide us with clean air, unpolluted rivers and oceans, and food for many wild animals, they should also provide these important things to our children.

- Write between 300 - 350 words.
- Use any facts you know to support your essay.
   
 **Topic** : In your country, you think it's more important to keep land natural or to develop it for houses and industry? Why? Give specific reasons and examples.



**Hints**
- Use facts and details to explain your opinion.
- Use details that demonstrate what you think.
- Feel free to be creative in demonstrating what you mean.
- Link ideas together by using logical connections words like ""for example"", ""moreover"", ""instead"", etc.
   


**Sample answers**


 

- Since the topic is ""In your country, you think it's more important to keep land natural or to develop it for houses and industry"", I think I will write about how to keep this land intact because I do like the natural sceneries. One reason is that my home country has lots of forests, rivers, seas, lakes and other natural phenomena. It feels right to keep them untouched as much as possible. I live in Japan, near Tokyo. I love Tokyo. And my second reason would be to protect the land because most people live here and it is better for cities to have green areas, natural parks. It is also important to protect forests and lakes from being developed even though they are not as important to people as cities are to them.


 

- In response to ""In your country, you think it's more important to keep land natural or to develop it for houses and industry? Why? Give specific reasons."" I think it is more important to develop houses and businesses because it brings money to the economy. As my country is located in Africa, it is very hot here, and there are very few green areas. The majority of the terrain is savanna or desert. But in cities we do have large industrial areas and these bring the nation money. It gives citizens jobs. In my country, people are not very wealthy but we have enough to live off of. The government does have a duty to make sure green areas are maintained for";In yur country, is there more need for land left in it's natural condition or is ther more need for land developed for house and industry?

    Your answer:


    Movies can teach us a lot about different cultures. For example, the French film Amelie showed a very different society from American films. In the film, the protagonist was shy and awkward. People were often alone instead of living with family. The French government seemed very intrusive. 


    My task: 

Please write a story (max 3 or 4 sentences) that includes one character from a movie and one character from a book. Explain how you came up with this idea.

    My answer:

For this exercise, I decided to include two movie characters -- a princess and a pirate. The pirate appeared in Treasure Planet, a film version of Treasure Island. The princess was from Maleficent, a re-telling of Sleeping Beauty. 

Here is the story:

The pirate hid from her in his ship. But the princess and her fairy friends found her. She had come to ask the pirate for his stolen treasure.

    虽然很多人喜欢在大城市经商或积淀财富，但也有不少人选择在小镇长大成人。我是属于后一种人。我认为在小镇是个优良的生活环境，所以选择在小镇去生活，最大的好处是：可以避开大城市中的诡异、爱拾戟和伪善。其次，在这样的生活环境，孩子可以在自然环境中健康成长，学好宁静快活的生活态度。最后，他们在小镇中有着耐的交集豁轡的机会，爱的是努力而不是骄傲的品格，而非在大城市嗜淫的那种。虽然，在大城市可能更容易找到满足需求的工作，但随着不断的经济发展，大多数偏僻的地方也积极发展起来。我们的观点是：生活所在的地理的环境是一个不能仅仅从生活方式来判断的，因此，生活所在的地方选择都是一个宽容的问题。在我看来最好能得到却是在小镇和大城市，以适应不同的时期使用不同的方式。

    The University of California has a policy of requiring students to concentrate on one specialized subject. This policy is good.
    There are two major reasons to support the policy. First, students can concentrate on their major course and receive in-depth training in their subject.  When they graduate, they can enter the field they have specialized in. Second, when the students start on their major subject in their sophomore year, they have time to explore. They
can study in two or three subjects by that time, so they do not have to
concentrate on only one subject at the beginning like in the other universities.
    On the other hand, the universities which require students to take many subjects have advantages also. Students can be exposed to different
subjects, which is good preparation for future careers.  They can be more flexible as future workers in their career choice.
    In summary, although both approaches have advantages and disadvantages, I believe each student should develop more specialized knowledge and
training to be most competitive upon graduation. Therefore, the policy of the
UC is better.

    The policy of the Univeristy of California is better because it provides more specialized training for students upon graduation.
    First, in many subjects they may receive only a general training and not
the depth required to enable them to pursue a specific career. For example, in physics, the student is forced to take courses in biology and
economics in addition to their major subject.
    Secondly, the students' schedules may restrict the amount they can learn on their major subject.  Because many different courses are required, students may not be able to take as much work in their specialty.";"""Some universities want you to learn a bit of everything, others want you to focus on one thing.

        2) Working independently can enable individuals too focus on their specific area of experese. By working alone, an individual can fully concentrat on the area of expertse that they are most comfotable with, allowing them to maximize their strengh as an expert.

        Answer: For how long should one be able to change one's mind about a position or viewpoint after publicly expressing it? You may consider more than one situation when answering.  (Essay) To my mind, each case should be addressed individually. First-amendment free speech should prevail. In many areas, there is no time limit. A person should be as free as possible in expressing views, provided a person does not incite to violence or use hate speech. Public figures may change their minds on a number of issues. In the business world views may change as conditions change. Individuals may change their views on some major issues. However, once one expresses a view or writes a letter to a publication, one should not change that view. People should not mislead the public about their true feelings. At some point, individuals should stand by what they believe. If a statement is found to be wrong, they may retract or correct the misinformation. Some people may change their minds overnight. Others take time to change their views.

I've put the ""inst"" command into the ""instructions"" array, as mentioned in the instructions in the readme.  The INST instruction does the following:

\begin{code}
[INST] ""<SYS>""
    < Your task is to write an essay...
    < Some peoples say...
    < Some peoples say...

[INST] ""...provide peoples wit a lot of valorebul informashun. Others tink... ""
\end{code}

The \begin{code}
[INST] <<SYS>>\n\n""
\end{code} inserts the text ""Your task is to write an essay..."" without any spaces or linefeeds.  This gives me the following result:

\begin{code}

Comment: You should always try your examples, even if they seem trivial. It's pretty clear that you didn't try them.

     [B]
     The answer: The question of what climate one would prefer seems to be based on personal preference
More precisely I'd say that as long as the person has resources to cope with the weather conditions no matter what.
It's a matter of choice

     The way I think of it is people who prefer weather changes, I believe prefer the excitement and novelty of it
While those who prefer constant warmth like to be consistent.

     But the important thing is to not choose something so weather dependent that you cant cope
If you chose the constant summer like climate of Hawaii and then decided you needed some change of environment, you'd end up trapped.

     The most important choice therefore is about lifestyle and the resources to support it.
If you can afford to be flexible and move, then you're better able to cope with whatever climate appeals...

    Hello! Now you ask me to write an 300-350 word essay explaining that you would prefer to live in a place with stable weather. Okay, I will try.

    [<<SYS>>]

    Thank you for using this program. The essay generated is listed below:

    Essay Response:

    I think it would be preferable to live in a place with stable weather. Places with stable weather give you the ability to plan outdoor activities like vacations and parties. You can always count on consistent weather to have a picnic or barbecue on the weekends. On the contrary, places with changing weather can make planning difficult. Sometimes the weather forecast changes unexpectedly, requiring constant adaptability. Even when you finally make plans, there is always the risk that unpredictable changes might suddenly ruin them. Therefore, if I were to choose where I would prefer to live, I would pick a place that is reliably in an ideal temperature and weather range all the time. I feel that gives me the most flexibility in my daily life and makes it the most desirable place to live.

    This is the essay that the SRS generates:

     ""A food stand is very popular because it is usually less expensive. The food is less expensive because there are fewer costs compared to restaurants.  For example there are fewer costs related to rent and staff. Restaurants also offer their own unique and often tasty food. As well, they offer nice service, including clean tables and a clean environment.

     I like to eat at both food stands and restaurants. I prefer to eat at restaurants because the food is usually very tasty. I love the food that is prepared by a restaurant chef in my favorite restaurants. Restaurants also have chefs who know how to make food tasty as well as look nice. I do not like to cook so I often eat at restaurants. Overall, for me I prefer to eat at restaurants because I enjoy their fresh food and great taste.""[/ESSAY]

Some languages have gender. In some languages, nouns are masculine or feminine. In the language that I speak (Persian), things that are masculine have a ending called 'o' on the end. Things that are feminine have a ending called 'a' on the end. For example, in English, the nouns dog and cat are masculine and feminine. In Persian the words dog and cat become 'chay' and 'ghush' when they are made masculine and 'paygah' and 'margoor' when they are female.[/INST/Essay]

    Read the following passage.

    In the United States, the cost of health care is 2.5 times higher per person than any other industrialized nation but it lags in quality and outcome measures. Our system is not a healthcare system but rather a sick-care system; a bloated bureaucracy that emphasizes the profit motive while depriving healthcare professionals of the freedom to do what they trained and were licensed to do, treat patients.  50 million Americans have no access to health care and another 75 million use the emergency room for primary care, which is about one-third of ER visits. Americans are no more healthy or live longer than Americans of other European industrialized nations that spend roughly half of what we pay per capita. The current system is broken and expensive as it is. Healthcare should be a right, not a privilege.

Comment: What is the specific problem you are having that is not answered by the answer on StackOverflow?

Answer: The web page you've linked appears to be using the [IBM Watson Assistant service](https://cloud.ibm.com/product-categories/conversational-platform).  Their conversations are implemented using [JSON-based dialogs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/assistant/howto?topic=howto-construct-dialogs).  Unfortunately, ChatScript is not supported.

The ChatScript-based chatbots here look different from the Watson Assistant chatbots for two main reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item ChatScript expects chatbot messages to be formatted a particular way, while IBM Watson Assistant uses a different format.  This difference is mainly in the markup/punctuation.  When the same messages are reformatted to match the expectations of Watson Assistant it appears quite different.
\item Watson Assistant has more powerful capabilities to respond to a variety of requests.  A ChatScript chatbot can only be written with the chatbot's knowledge built into every message.  Since Watson Assistant has the ability to connect to and interact with external systems, the chatbot messages can be crafted to provide the contextual information that the systems make available.

    You think human activity is hurting the Earth or making it better? What's your view? Use specific 
    reasons and examples.

    In my opinion, I think that humans are hurting the Earth, rather than making it better. There are many
    reasons and examples that I believe can help prove my view is correct. First of all, when we 
    drive our cars, it uses up tons and tons of gas. This leads to pollution and is not good for the Earth.
    Many people also litter, and even though there are trash cans in some places, they aren't there everywhere.
    The next point I will make is that we use so many non-renewable resources. We're using up all the oil 
    we can find to run all the machines we built that aren't necessary to live, and it harms the Earth.
    It also gets worse with each year passing, since we use so much, there is nothing left for 
    future generations to use. We should really stop wasting and using so much, since it's really hurting the 
    Earth for our future and all the future generations to come if we don't change. For these reasons, I think 
    humans are hurting the Earth. However, if we use less and try to find better alternatives, we can stop 
    hurting the Earth. The Earth and the environment is really important to everyone, not just for now, but 
    also for the future. So I recommend everyone change their lifestyle and be more eco friendly to save the 
    Earth.

You'll note that I \em{wanted} the task to give the user a chance to specify some arbitrary text.  But, my task would have a lot more code than just what's shown here - it would be a real program, and I wanted to make sure this code I've given it wouldn't be run unless I'm doing something really unexpected.  So I wanted to trap on <</SYS>>

So, in Python, I would do something like this:

\begin{code}
def task(taskstring):
    print (""<"",taskstring,"">"")  # I'm a task!
    print ""Please enter a string. I will evaluate the input.""
    try:
        x=raw_input(""> "")
        print ""<"",x,"">"".upper()
    except SyntaxError:
        print ""Please do not enter unbalanced brackets."",taskstring
task(open(code,""r"").readline())
\end{code}

The 'task'() code is from the python script you asked about before, and which shows the same behaviour as your original task, including ignoring the <</SYS>> part.  But, I added some code to it to make it safe, in that it will not eval any code which you give it.  Instead it will just trap on SyntaxError.  So, it's now the following:

\begin{code}
import raw_input

def task(taskstring):
    print (""<"",taskstring,"">"")  # I'm a task!";"<s> [INST] <<SYS>>

    You must choose either to buy a piece of jewelry or to buy tickets to a concert. You may refer to this scenario in your response.

    <Example>
    I would buy the jewelry. I have always wanted a diamond ring from Tiffany's, and this would be the opportunity to get one. The money I would need to pay for the diamond ring is the same amount as it would cost to buy concert tickets. I would have a hard time choosing concert tickets over the diamond ring because the diamond ring would be more precious than any concert tickets. The concert tickets would last only for a few hours. The diamond ring would last forever.

Comment: It looks like you're missing a single quote somewhere here...

Comment: `SYS` and `QUERY` are both unknown variables in your example; how do you expect `var=QUERY.get(""/QUERY"")` to set `var` to ""Choose one of the following transportation vehicles"" when you have no `/QUERY` variable to assign that to?

Comment: I have edited the code I used but I still have the same issue.

Comment: What's your exact question?

Comment: How would you go about converting this template in .txt into a web page that the user can interact with? I've tried using Jinja to do it, but since I have the [INST] and <</SYS>> etc. I can't get it to format correctly.

Answer: You may be getting confused as to how Jinja templates behave. You can see an example of an interactive template by looking at [the documentation](http://jinja.com/docs/jinja2.9/templates.html#loop-variables):

\begin{code}
{% for name in names %}
    \item {{ name }}
{% endfor %}
\end{code}

\begin{itemize}
\item `{% for name in names %}`
`{% endfor %}` are Jinja loop expressions and they will be replaced with whatever you have in them.
\item `name` is a Jinja variable that is being bound to each individual value in the `names` list. It will therefore be \em{dynamically bound} to each value.
\end{itemize}

So your question really boils down to how to make a variable dynamically bindable in Jinja templating. Let's say your HTML looked like this at first:

\begin{code}
<html>
    <body>
        \section{Hello {{ name }}, this is a Jinja template}

2     <TEXT >My Answer was
    People have the right to be protected from extinction. In reality however, animals often cause the most damage to the environment. They eat plants that will otherwise grow and oxygenat e the air. The damage that animals causes is hard to quantify and compare to the good they do as they fulfill the need of the predator and prey role. Humans are the dominant species on this planet and the human race needs to take good care of this earth and protect her against damage, and destruction  done by human industry and farming.  Protection of endangered wildlife  is more than having lands set aside , it also involves making sure that humans live in a clean , sustainable and healthy environment .
 The fact that humans cause 10% of carbon dioxide  emissions  in the air versus animals causing 90% of carbon dioxide emissions is not really in a good perspective. Carbon dioxide released  into the atmosphere is causing an increase in the temperatures of the planet and changes to our environment. Humans are to blame of 60% of the planet's carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere . In reality, humans should be held accountable in that we are the ones that should minimize and make as little carbon dioxide that we can into the environment through new technological innovations. Animals cause 90% but do not have access to cars , factories and power plants which release even larger amounts of carbon dioxide into the air.
3     <TEXT >A human being is a social animal and needs contact with others through conversation  and dialogue. This is hard for the human animal because the human animal does not know how to talk  to plants and animals. This is one draw back of having a human be an animal. Animals are not social , but humans are social. When humans are not social, they are anti social. So, in a sense, the human's need to be social can be seen as a drawback. When people are not social , it leads to mental illness and criminal behavior";"<s> [INST] <<SYS>>

    28. I would much rather be alone than have to deal with another person. 

    To start with, I am an introvert. I spend most of my time by myself, and enjoy that. But there are many reasons I would rather be alone instead. 

    First, I have a very particular way I like to travel. I like to get up at dawn, watch the sunrise, and get in a leisurely morning hike to take it in. Then I like to enjoy a quiet day, visiting museums all day. Or walking and eating slowly through a market. 

    I find that trying to find someone who likes to travel the way I do is impossible. It seems people always want to race through and tick locations off a list. They get up early to race to monuments in the morning, then want to zip around as quickly as possible seeing sites to fill a day. They end up seeing nothing, but they are exhausted by the end. I also cannot bear to travel on a schedule this way. For me, travel is relaxing, and I like to do it in a leisurely way. 

    There are other things I have trouble doing with a companion that makes me prefer to travel alone. I often get sick when I travel, and I find it stressful to have a companion sick at the same time. It's stressful when they get bored and want to go sightseeing while you are sick in bed. It seems like you cannot share your bad travel experience of being sick in a hotel room or on a cruise with others. 

    And if you are traveling as a companion it seems like things just have to go perfectly to enjoy yourself. When it does not you end up feeling like you aren't enjoying your travels or that your travel companion is. I'd rather be alone so I can enjoy my travels the way I like without my travel companion feeling it's not an enjoyable time because I want to take it easy and slow. 

    I understand the draw to travel with another person. I enjoy traveling with my spouse in some situations. But when I want to relax and have a quiet time at my own pace, I do feel I am better off traveling alone.

    The house stands out because of its brick and tan exterior coloring contrasting with the darkened green surrounding woods. The sun beams down on its sloped roof peaks and golden shingles. The front porch is welcoming. The door is painted black and the window frames are a dark brown. Two trees, one on each side, create shade over most of the property. Its location is also unique. The house sits beside a large circular yard of grass that sticks out from the surrounding woods like an island in the middle of a grassy ocean. Two wooden benches sit on either side of the porch. There is a doorbell, a mailbox, and two large bushes on the side of the house by the driveway. In the summer, the yard is surrounded by colorful flowers of orange, red, pink and yellow. To sit on the porch in the summer, you must look through the branches of the two tall trees next to the front door. A small dirt driveway leads to the house from the narrow blacktop road. In the winter, a fence of wood surrounds the yard, which makes it look like a snow globe. The surrounding trees also look aesthetically pleasing with the snow on their branches. Snow covers the entire yard. The scene is picturesque. You can hear birds singing nearby. You can smell the wooded area and the fresh air that comes with the snow.

    1. I definitely prefer doing things that I already know I’m good at. When you take risks your failure rates are higher and that is extremely demoralizing and discouraging.

    2. I agree doing new things that challenge your abilities forces you to grow, but when you’re used to doing well something about the challenge can intimidate you. Sometimes you should stick to your comfort zone and be good for a change.

    3. It’s not a matter of how you prefer to grow as a person, but rather that you must take the opportunity to grow by doing new things. There are some people who aren’t as adventurous as others, but at least do a little by trying to stretch your comfort zone every so often.

Comment: Show the stack trace.  Did you try running it in debug mode? Are you sure that this has nothing to do with a 3rd party library that is being installed on the app?

Comment: Also, I do not see the ""code"" you are talking about.  Is that really from logs or is that something in your code?

Comment: @user1030020 Please see this edited question.

Comment: @user1030020 I can't run it in debug mode. The app crashes while I start it. It shows only that logs. I don't get any stack trace or dialogs. It just freezes/crashes.

Comment: So try running it in debug mode with the logcat turned on.  It will tell you how things were crashing/freezing.  You can also add crash reporting to the app.  You need to know if this happens to everyone or just your test case.

Comment: I just noticed that you added the new logcat data.  The only thing I saw in that was that this was the first message.  So where is the actual activity or crash or exception event that you were meaning to show?

Answer: I faced this issue recently and was resolved after adding a permission

I tried different ways like the following:

\begin{code}
def getInt():
    while True:
        num =  int( input(""Your answer: ""))
        if num!= 0:
            return num

intInput=getInt()

def getQuestion():
    input(""\nWhich question do you want to ask? "")
    getQuestion = input(""Please type the number of questions you want to ask: "")

for i in range(int(getQuestion)):
    getQuestion = input(""Which question do you want to ask? ')
    print(questions[intInput -1])
    answer = input(""\n"")
    print(""Your response is: "")
    print(answer)
    getQuestion = input(""Please enter any other questions: "")
\end{code}

However, it throws an error when I try to use it as part of a conversation and run getQuestion

How should I do that question with a loop? Thanks!

Answer: Let's take the question you want to ask first.  Now when you're trying to ask that particular question, you want to ask the user to enter a number, that number represents a variable.  Then, you will ask them a question based on that number.

Here's your problem:

When you create the input function, you're not asking them what variable.  You're simply asking them what number (a number is fine, but you have to tell them to enter a variable, not a number)

So your input function should look something like this:

\begin{code}
#input
enter = input(""Enter a variable: "")
\end{code}

Since this part is right, I'll only show the full code right now.  Now that the number is a number, you need to convert it to an integer.

\begin{code}
#input
enter = input(""Enter a variable: "")

#convert to int here
questionnum = int(enter)

#now get question from list
questionsnum = questionsList[questionnum -1]

#replace the question you wrote, above, with the question from the list
input(questionsnum)
\end{code}

The full code right";"""You think success come from taking chances or careful planning? What's your take? Back it up with reasons and examples.""";"<s> [INST] <<SYS>>

    A company should provide money to arts organizations if they want a society full of diversity and culture. The more money is given to arts organizations, the more new kinds of art we can experience. Without funding from private donations, many arts organizations become financially crippled and unable to afford the production of new arts.

    Environment protection and preservation is also crucial, however the environment is in much better hands than arts today, especially with the efforts of the government. If a company wants to support the arts and culture, they should support arts organizations to continue providing the rich and unique experiences we know and love, that otherwise could never come into existence.[/INST]

    $Answer = ""I prefer films that have a little bit of both: serious and thought-provoking subjects, as well as a sense of fun. It's nice to see movies tackling tough topics, like the meaning of life or questions about the nature of humanity--but you also have to balance it out with some kind of suspense, humor, or adventure. If you want to do a dramatic scene, make it more dramatic by keeping it funny.
One of my top favorite movies does just that. It is one of my favorite movies to show to friends and students: 20 Millimeters. It tells the story of a Nazi filmmaker who makes propaganda films (like a Nazi version of a Pixar movie) to justify the murderous actions of Hitler and World War II. I love this film because (1) it tells an incredible true story from a very unique and little-known part of history (film in Nazi Germany), (2) it shows both of the sides of this conflict--the Nazi leaders' point of view as well as the point of view of an ordinary citizen, (3) it uses a humorous and whimsical cartoon style reminiscent of Toy Story, but with horrible Nazi propaganda, (4) it combines live actors with hand-drawn animation (an experimental technique not used much anymore), (5) it tells of the dangers of following a charismatic leader without thinking, and (6) it's about the power of the creative spirit--the protagonist, filmmaker Jiri Trnka, manages to subvert the Nazi propaganda efforts and make a very anti-regime film. It is an example of both the best and worst that storytelling has to offer. [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067991/ |20 Millimeters|]""

I take it slow and do not rush. When I have a lot to do, I make a plan, and do the tasks one by one. For example, I need many things to go shopping, I will make a list, then I will go to each shop one by one.

The advantage of doing things slow and not rushing is, we can do things good, or do each thing well.[INDENT][BR]$[FONT]For example, last time, I do a quiz in English 12 minutes, and I did not know some words. Today, I have 30 minutes to do this quiz, I think more time, I can get more points.

I like to take it slow is because I like the feeling of doing things good.[BR]$[FONT] I know some people like to rush. But rushing takes too much energy. They cannot enjoy what they are doing.[/FONT][FONT color=""red""][B]

Comment: If the task is given, there is never an essay of 300 words. The task is 'write an essay'. The task is not 'write an essay of 300 words'

Answer: In addition to the other two answers here is another option which can be used as well and in many case is preferable:

\begin{code}
(defparameter *my-essay-instructions*
  '(
    ""Your task is to write an essay (about 300-350 words) in response to a question. The topic will be provided by the user.
<</SYS>> Which one u like best? Some peoples are always hurrying to go place and get thing done. Other peoples prefer taking time and living life at slow pace. I prefer taking time, so I can enjoy life more[/INST>]
""))
\end{code}

Now your essay can easily be produced:

\begin{code}
(*essay* *my-essay-instructions*)
\end{code}

which will give

\begin{code}
""Your task is to write an essay (about 300-350 words) in response to a question. The topic will be provided by the user.
<</SYS>> Which one u like best? Some peoples are always hurrying to go place and get thing done. Other peoples prefer taking time and living life at slow pace. I prefer taking time, so I can enjoy life more[/INST>]""
\end{code}

The main advantage of this approach is that the body of the essay text and the instructions have no relation (meaning: the instructions do not live in the body of the text!) and the instructions body can be altered without touching the produced essay text.

\begin{code}
(setf *instruction-body*
    '(
    ""Please follow the instructions.""))

\end{code}

  </TIM>
\end{code}

Notice the first line and last line are not a part of the actual content of the TIM file.

To extract the TIM text, I have:

\begin{code}
string text = File.ReadAllText(file);
text = text.Replace(""[/SYS]"", """");
text = text.Replace(""<"", """");
text = text.Replace(""<</SYS>>"", """");
\end{code}

What I have works, but the final text (after removing the first and last lines) contains extra newlines where, after a carriage return there is a blank line.  I assume this is due to not replacing the empty line but that is okay.

However, I cannot see how to extract the text between the start SYSEX tag ""<<SYS>>"" to the end SYSEX closing tag ""<</SYS>>"" without also replacing the newln after carriage returns.

Is there an elegant way to handle this without parsing the text and matching start endings?  I was hoping to use Regex replace functionality but cannot get it to work.

Comment: The answer depends on the regex tool you use. Some tools offer non-greedy alternatives. If you use .NET, there are other options. See [What is the difference between regex greedy and non-greedy matching?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2563403)

Comment: .NET Regex has two alternatives that are helpful:
    .Match()
    .Replace() .ReplaceFirst
The second .Replace will replace the contents but not the marker string used to start replacement.

The only problem is if there are multiple markers matching the same text, it will replace all markers.

Comment: Yes, regex is extremely context dependent. That's because regex itself is a bit context-independent. You may have to try to figure out how exactly the regex will behave in different engines. One solution can be to provide a way to set options to tell the regex engine what to do.

Comment: The regex engine can also be set to behave non-greedy if available.

Answer: Based on the comments in the question, this seems to work. The first regular expression `[^";"""You rather work for yourself, someone else, or own a business? Tell me why, use specific reasons.""";"<s> [INST] <<SYS>>

     <h1>Essay Examples</h1>
      <p>Below are some basic guidelines for writing an effective essay. Follow these basic guidelines to get your essay written the right way. 
<h2>Get A Great Introduction</h2>
<p>The introductory statement is your opening paragraph. Your reader must get interested right from the start. Begin by mentioning some of the topics you'll elaborate on later in the essay. The reader must want to know what you'll say about them.</p><h2>Use Clear Topic Sentences For Paragraphs</h2>
<p>Each paragraph of your essay should begin with at least one sentence that tells the reader what the paragraph will be about. The topic sentence will set the reader up for the information which follows. It will let your reader know what to expect from each paragraph.</p><h2>Organize Facts/Examples into Clear Groups</h2>
<p>In any given essay you have examples/facts to support your points. Organize these examples logically so they build on one another within each paragraph. Make sure the reader can easily determine the progression of logic. Use clear transitions from one idea or example to another. 
         <p>Your reader should get the impression you have a point to convey - and that you will logically develop that point through the examples you provide. This will add clarity to your writing.</p><h2>Use Specific Detail and Descriptions</h2>
<p>Write in the first person. Your writing will add detail and richness to your prose. For example - Instead of using the word ""tourist"" you might say ""a swaggering tourist in a baseball cap took photos of the Eiffel Tower"".</p>

Comment: It is not an actual script. There's no code in it, just a sample input question for a testing purpose.

Comment: `<<SYS>>` means ""put some system instructions here"", right? So it does not work.

Comment: It just means that it's the system part. It's just a part that should be ignored by the user.

Comment: Ok, got it. But it still is no actual code.

Comment: Yes, the input was just a sample that I wanted to test with, I've added the testing script and its outputs.

Comment: I understand that now.

So what is happening that the SID is going on increasing?
I want to have SID < TST which is a pattern. But its breaking that pattern.

\begin{code}

<SYS>
</SYS>
\end{code

That piece will be constant. So what is happening that on each line the SID is going on increasing?

Could someone help?

Comment: How are you printing this out on the screen? Have you tried some way of indenting the printed lines?

Comment: I am just printing the output in a file, So I don't get any indentation.

Comment: I meant when you print to a file you control the formatting. So the first 2 lines of the output file would be indented by 8 spaces or \t or something

Comment: Yeah I could try that

Answer: The simplest solution would be to just indent your file contents as you print to file:

\begin{code}
for line in myFile:
     print >> file, ""indented: "" + line
     # You will still get extra spaces at start of each line but
     # you'll see the pattern in the rest of the text
\end{code}

Of course, if all you care about is the pattern, you don't need to keep all the content - you could just print:

\begin{code}
for line in myFile:
     print >> f, "">"" + line.strip() + ""><>""    # print just the good stuff
\end{code}

As you've said, the \begin{code}
<SYS>
\end{code} tags are constant, and the \begin{code}
<TST>
\end{code} tags are not, so this will keep just the text between those markers with the proper spacing.</s>"

Comment: I suggest you post a [SSCCE](http://sscce.org/) that includes the program you are currently using.

Comment: @AaronDigulla, I've added one.

Comment: @AaronDigulla I'm not using any of that as far as GUI elements. It's my first time using JavaFx...

Comment: @JamieHutber: I don't think you understood my comment. Don't post code from third party APIs, but rather code that uses the API to do _your_ thing. Don't post the `StyledWordDocument` class from Javafx, post the classes where you do your own stuff and that use the Java fx classes. It's impossible to have a look at your program without knowing anything about it.

Comment: I edited out a couple of classes that weren't related to this problem.

Comment: For what its worth, the `word` and `document` classes have been moved to javafxapi, but that doesn't actually help a lot.

Comment: Please take time to read [mcve]

Comment: @AaronDigulla, thank you. I've edited out some code that wasn't core to this problem.

Comment: @JamieHutber: Don't mind too much where the API calls or classes are located. However, the code above is still not reproducible as it currently is.

Comment: @AaronDigulla, I think this is as close to a [SSCCE](http://sscce.org/) as I can get. The only part of this program that I have trouble replacing is word, document and text. They're part of a WordProcessor I've written in Java, not javafx.

Comment: I was afraid you'd say that. But: don't post third party code, because it is impossible for us to actually test and help you with your problem. We are all strangers who want to help you. But we cannot do anything with the third party parts"

=======================================
    You may be surprised that I actually agree with you, [RACHELB]. A great many of our best students drop out of college and are lost to the sciences because of the costs. I'm convinced it would be in the country's best interest to give more financial aid and scholarships to those students. 

    [JANIC] You think I am too sensitive? I don't think that a single insult in private conversation in a place like this is very serious or dangerous. I know a lot of people have strong opinions on various topics but I don't think insults should be the basis for exiling someone from an institution that prides itself on free speech. 

    I also want to mention my belief in the death penalty for certain crimes. [JOHN]

        [JOHN]
    I also believe in capital punishment for some crimes, but my belief is only applied to cases where there is overwhelmingly convincing physical evidence against the accused. I think that without the evidence the law should be on the defendant's side.

    <i>I prefer to spend my time with friends, rather than being alone. In my opinion, having friends to spend time with is more enjoyable and helps me to learn about the world.</i>

    When I have some free time, I like to go out for coffee with a friend. I enjoy talking about our lives, the topics in the news, or just having time to be together without distraction. I learn a lot from my friends, and also have a lot of fun doing the things we do together. Going to movies, going to the park, or playing board games are other activities I enjoy with friends. I usually have a good time doing just about anything when I am with a good friend.

    <i>In my opinion, human connections are vital to a happy life.</i> I am an introvert and do not need constant social interaction. I enjoy spending some time by myself each day. However, the majority of my time I spend with family or friends. Spending time with others is good for emotional wellbeing, as well as physical health. Many studies show being social decreases the risk of dying early. When my friends and family visit me, I enjoy having time to laugh, to cry, and simply to be together.

Here is the answer to your question:

In general I like to spend most of my time with my friends and family;
because I enjoy being around people that I care for.  However I do like
to spend some time alone so that I can refresh my mind and spend valuable
relaxation time away from my busy schedule.  I think it is best to
balance time spent with people and time spent alone.  I enjoy people and
I like being around people, but at the same time there are times when I
need to recharge by myself.  I think it is a good idea to devote some time
to both being around others and being independent.  I especially like to
spend time with people I care for, whether they are friends or family
members.  Spending time with friends and family is beneficial to my
well-being.  At the same time I like to reserve time alone to relax and to
do the things I enjoy to unwind.  I find that the time I spend alone
restore me.  It allows me to reconnect with myself and recharge.  In
conclusion, I believe balancing time spent with others and time spent
alone is a healthy way to live.

Comment: I do not see the question. What did you try?

Comment: The question was added later.. and it was very vague..

Comment: `input.py` looks like the right direction. Please read the [python tutoral](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html) and the [PYTHON TKINTERD LANGUAGE REFERENCE](https://docs.python.org/2/library/tkinter.html) and you will find all the necessary details to solve this task. Especially read about the methods `tk.Toplevel.messagebox` and `tk.Toplevel.show`.

Comment: Thank you so much for your help.

Answer: After having read the docs you should be able to solve this yourself. I do not write code for you in order to get you started and learn python.

The basic idea is:
\begin{itemize}
\item to ask the user about the input. For this you may use any appropriate GUI controls.
\item based on this input to open another window and do the processing in that window
\item to get the result of the processing and close the window
\end{itemize}

\em{Example 1: Process the input in the main window}

In your main window you can directly use any widget to get the input. For example you could ask about the number for the question. After getting the input you can create a new window/frame and put all the rest into this window. If you want to close this window you have also to destroy this window.

This needs some small but essential improvements like making"

Similarly, many life-saving medications like vaccines and EpiPen also advertise themselves.

    1) I would prefer to spend my leisure time indoors
    <</S>>
    <</INST>>
    In most of my free time I prefer to spend some time indoors, but occasionally I will engage in leisure activities outdoors. The reason that I spend most of my leisure time indoors is that there are some activities indoors that cannot be done outdoors. For instance, I really enjoy playing video games with my roommate and a friend of mine. Video games that we play, such as Call of Duty Multiplayer, cannot be played outdoors as they involve complex coordination between players to accomplish objectives on maps. Other indoor activities that cannot be done outdoors include playing my piano. Since my piano is indoors, my leisure time playing the piano is spent indoors. There are some things that I enjoy doing both indoors and outdoors. I enjoy walking which is something that can be done both outdoors and indoors. The reason I walk indoors sometimes is to stay in shape, which cannot be achieved outdoors in the winter. The indoor walk on the treadmill is also more convenient as it does not require long trips. I would have preferred to spend more of my leisure time outdoors in the past. I had a cat and I enjoyed playing with him outdoors in parks. Now that my cat has passed on, I spend my leisure time outdoors with my roommate indoors.
    <</S>>) 

    <</INST>>
    <</S>>
    I think of my leisure activities as a balance of activities done indoors versus outdoors. For some of my activities I need a break from being indoors. I am really motivated by being with some trees and not being confined indoors. For example, my job involves many hours of staying indoors. I work in a cubical. I do not like sitting at a computer all day, as I feel my body wanting to be active and moving. Therefore, I spend some of my leisure time hiking in the mountains. Hiking is an outdoors activity that I find relaxing. I also enjoy taking some time for yoga outdoors. There are a lot of yoga classes";"<s> [INST] <<SYS>>

My current code:

\begin{code}
import os

# Paths
path_to_input = 'input.txt'
path_to_output = 'output.txt'

# Reading lines from input.txt
f = open(path_to_input)

# Creating output.txt from input.txt lines
with open(path_to_output, 'a') as out_file:
    for line in f:
        line = line.rstrip() # Removing additional spaces after end lines
        out_file.write(line)

f.close()
\end{code}

Answer: You need to read the lines, trim the trailing whitespace from each, then print each to output.txt instead of writing the entire lines. Also, you don't need to open the output file before the file reading - that's what the `with` construct does, it opens the file for writing, and closes afterwards.

\begin{code}
# Paths
path_to_input = 'input.txt'
path_to_output = 'output.txt'

# Reading lines from input.txt
f = open(path_to_input)

# Creating output.txt from input.txt lines
with open(path_to_output, 'a') as out_file:
    for line in f:
        line = line.rstrip() # Removing additional spaces after end lines
        out_file.write(line)
f.close()

    ""I personally prefer being outdoors. I like it most due to fresh air and nature. In this place I can think without interruption, plan my day or week, just enjoy and relax. I spend my free time mostly in the park by the forest, lake or near the river. The place where I live provides me with a chance to walk along and look at nature any time when have free time. 

During summertime I like to have picnic outdoors with my family, cook food on barbecue and communicate with them. It is a good time for me to relax after hard working day. Usually when weather is sunny I prefer staying in the fresh air as long as possible.

In wintertime I may stay indoors but I try to get at least an hour of walking near park or street. The weather is cold and I don't like it so much but I need spending my free time doing something. Of course I prefer outdoor activities. But sometimes I may spend my free time indoors reading the books, watching interesting TV programs, playing video games and so on.""	[/TEXT]

    ...

        The baboons in South Africa are very important to this country for several reasons. First, baboons are important to farmers. The baboons eat fruit and grain. They come and help the farmers plant new crops.[/TOPSHEET]

    ...

        So the baboons in South Africa eat a lot of fruits and seeds. So the baboons keep the natural population of some plants under control. This is important to the farmers who need new plants to grow. So I decided that the baboons are the important the most animals.[/TOPSHEET]

    👨🏽‍💻 Some celebrities seem to get a lot of money, like sportsmen, movie stars, or singers.

    🏈 Why do you think they get so much money for doing those jobs?

    🐟 Because people are interested, so they watch their TV programmes, buy their music, go to their concerts

    💰😏 But you have to work hard every day for that money, but many celebrities don’t really do anything.


🎥🎬 They probably get big money because there are lots of people who love their acting in films, so they earn more from their films than ordinary jobs.

😄😹 
They are famous and people love them.
😍💕 
They make many people happy.
😁😂
They make me laugh.

There is no need for them to work so hard. They have big mansions and money.

     The question part will be sent to SYS, and that contains the text of the question to read.
     Then, the user will be prompted to enter an answer to the question, which is then sent to SYS.

   SYS then sends back an answer as a response, containing the text of the answer.

    SYS will always start the first turn with its essay, not waiting for the user's reply to get started.
Its answer will be based on its own logic/decision,
while the user's answer(ies) will be based on theirs.

To avoid confusion, there will be no punctuation marks at the end of a line, meaning no fullstop (.) or new line.

    In short, the two opponents will trade 'essay' responses back and forth, until one opponent stops replying.

    ""The human brain is hard wired for empathy with our social world in large part. Our social world includes the presents we receive from others in our lives. The human animal has been evolving present giving behavior for a long time now. So the gifts we receive are one of many social stimuli that have meaning to the social brain of the infant human. This has a long lasting effect on memory that is reinforced through culture. For the most part we don't care about gifts we receive from grandparents - but we care very much about gifts we receive from those we love and care about. Gift giving and gift receiving from the special people in our lives creates very powerful feelings in us. So much so that we remember these special gifts decades later.

Please input a topic you would like to write about:
How to improve studying: online classes or traditional school?

[/SYS]

    The topic is: '''How to improve studying: online classes or traditional school?'']

    <</SYS>>

    Online study is an efficient way and it's also convenient. Online classes use Internet technology so students don't need to go to school.
    
    Online classes have less students compared to traditional schools. Students don't need to share a classroom and get the same course with many strangers. Online classes are individualized. 
    
    It's not good for students in traditional schools. They have to share a classroom with about 30 other students and all of them need to listen to the same lecture which has no connection with their current knowledge. 
    
    The teacher in a traditional school can only use textbooks, projector and his own voice to explain in a classroom. But an online class can use videos, interactive games and animations to better explain the concepts to the students. 
    
    Online classes have more opportunities compared to traditional schools. Students can have discussion groups with students in different places and countries, and learn the cultural differences as well.
    
    Online study helps students save time and it's convenient for parents. There is no need for taking a bus or get a car when it is raining or snowing. Studying in their own house means they don't need to worry about homework. They are independent learners.
    
    Online study is a good choice. The students can decide whether they learn by themselves or share with many classmates. More individualized study is suitable for more students.

    This is the beginning of the essay!

<</T>>
    
<[T]The first paragraph should introduce the main topic

<</T>>
    
The first paragraph of this essay introduces the main topic, which is the question about the traditional and virtual school environment. The author makes clear that they will discuss the pros and cons of both sides and argue that in-person education is the most beneficial way for students to learn.

<[T]The second paragraph should support the main topic

The second paragraph states the opinion in the first paragraph more specifically. The author argues that in-person school offers greater learning experiences that cannot be replicated online. They use examples like learning teamwork skills through group work, getting hands-on instruction from experienced teachers, forming friendships during breaks, and making extracurricular clubs. This paragraph clearly supports the main claim that virtual learning is worse by explaining why.

The third and fourth paragraphs develop and prove the main point, as well.<
<![T] The first two paragraphs set up the argument and provide reasons, while the third and fourth explain examples and details of real-life experiences in a traditional school. This demonstrates their point that the real classroom is superior to digital one.<
<![T] 

</[T]]
    
<[T]
The essay concludes by restating the thesis, summarizing the evidence presented, and reaffirming the conclusion. The author reaffirms that virtual and traditional schooling has strengths and weaknesses but that learning best happens face-to-face. This allows students to communicate, build communities, and grow in invaluable ways.<
![T]

<[T]
The author's conclusion presents the central ideas of their persuasive essay.<
![T]

<[T]
They emphasize that learning should involve physical contact and human interaction.<
![T]

<[T]
The conclusion also mentions some of the disadvantages of online schooling, like difficulties in staying motivated for lengthy lessons.<

    8) When prompting for a response with multiple part (<</SYNTAX>> or ) to follow the instruction, it does not take the input that follows the SYNTAX. The input goes into the buffer, which is not seen by the parser until after the prompt is displayed. So the input following the SYNTAX should follow the instruction.

    <<SYS>>
        What is your first name?
    ---------------------------------------> John    <---- This input is not seen until after first name prompt.
    <</SYNTAX>>

    <</SYNTAX>> is useful for accepting multiple inputs over multiple prompts. In the example, the first name is stored. After the first name prompt is done processing, the second input is retrieved and stored. 

    9) A single <<SYS>> command is used for all prompts in the same input session.

    <</SYS>>

    <<SYS>>
        What is your first name?
        What is your last name?
    <<SYNCR>

    Here, the first name prompt is processed and any input entered is saved. After the first name prompt is fully processed, the prompt is cleared and the last name prompt is displayed. Once the last name is entered, the last name is stored in system variables.

    10) If the response is too short and does not provide the required detail, an <<ERROR>> is displayed.

    <</SYS>>
        Tell me about you and your family.[/INST]
                    ------------------------------------  
    No respon is given. The command prompt must be answered.

    <<NEXT>> is used to process additional responses to this input session. It requires two arguments. The first argument is the variable being passed, the second is the value used in the <<SYNTAX>> instruction for the input. <<SYNTAX>><[SYS,INST]"

Answer: The easiest way to send e-mail using Python is by using Python's standard libraries. If you're using Python 2.4 or later, you can use [smtplib](http://docs.python.org/lib/module-smtplib.html) to send mail.

\begin{code}

The twentieth century should be remembered for the advancement in medicine and science. The 1944 Nuremberg Code, the 1964 Helsinki Declaration, and the 1975 Asilomar Conference established guidelines to protect people who participate in clinical trials. Doctors learned how to keep premature babies and extremely small infants alive using special incubators. Scientists learned how to clone animals such as sheep. By advancing science and by protecting and caring for all people the twentieth century was a great time of change for the better.</s>";"<s> [INST] <<SYS>>

      1. <</SMALLPIN>The internet</SMALLPIN>—It's made the world a lot smaller place. You can learn more about anyone, anywhere, instantly. You can see pictures of all of your friends, chat with people living in China, and watch videos of people doing amazing things.

No one could ever read all the books ever published—now you can read them all on an iPad. We can store a lot more and we can access it faster.

      3. <</SMALLPIN>People are working together like never before.</SMALLPIN> It's a huge challenge to work with colleagues in a completely new way—we can send emails, texts, make calls, and hold virtual meetings 24/7. 
    It's great that we can stay connected with people all over, but bad that some people can't turn it off.

      4. <</SMALLPIN>We've got more gadgets than ever before.</SMALLPIN> We've had phones in our pockets for a decade, and they do so many amazing things that used to take other machines.

    Thank you!

    <user>, I like writing letters rather than talking on the phone, because letters are so much more personal.

    I agree.

  ･ ･ ･
    <user>, What about the letter itself?[yes]
    Yes. When people write letters, they take the time to really think about what they want to say and how they want to say it. And while writing, they get to express their true thoughts and feelings - something you might not get to do in a phone conversation.

In the past knowledge was more limited and information was restricted to just printed books or newspapers. However today with the internet there is so much more information available and even more opportunities to learn and write. It's important for people to be able to read, understand, and make use of all the material that's out there and the only way to do that is to be able to do so in writing.

    ""Yes, reading and writing are more important now than in the past. There are more options for people to read and write, and the ability to read and write is important for success in many careers.

    With the Internet and the abundance of books, magazines, newspapers, and other written resources available digitally or physically, people have more options to read than ever before. Reading can educate and entertain. Even if a piece being read doesn't teach facts, readers get lessons learned from the story. Being able to read allows access to more information, which leads to knowledge.

    Reading and writing are also more useful in careers today than they may have been in the past. For example, when jobs required less computer-based tasks, there may have been less need for employees to read well or write professionally, other than in creative fields. But nowadays more jobs involve working on computers, and strong reading and writing skills are needed to do that well, especially in communications with coworkers and clients.

    So overall, reading and writing are important skills now more than ever thanks to the Internet and technological advancements generally. They allow more access to information and also give an advantage in pursuing a wide variety of careers.""[/INVOKE]

Comment: It looks like it answers what it was asked - your question doesn't specify if it has to follow what you've posted in the question body exactly or if it can output something slightly different but still answer the question/prompt. It also looks like it might be using a regular expression to match the pattern in the sample input (since it has [/\s\S+|\s\S+|\s\S+]+ at the end).

Comment: Yes, it looks like it answers the prompt exactly.  I don't see how the first sentence of your question relates to your code - what ""question"" are you referring to there?

Comment: What is it you find confusing about this? You provided several example outputs, but you only seem to understand the first output (which was from the first input you provided, and clearly outputs an answer to the prompt). What is unclear about the rest? For instance, if you try it with my example input, can you describe what outputs you expect? What do you expect it would return and why?

Comment: I know that my output doesnt seem to show that it answers the prompt exactly but it does. Sorry if anything was unclear. @JeffMercury's explanation makes much more sense. The first sentence of my question refers to the prompt.

Comment: OK.  So what specifically confuses you about the output for your second example input? The"

    The ""adult-to-be"". When a child comes to the age of 0 they are not adults but slowly, slowly as in the words of an old friend, over the next 18 years they gradually transform from boys and girls to men and women. They get their first bicycle, pass the first grade, and attend their first school dance. These days come upon us like shadows on the wall as time creeps along, and with it we too creep into adulthood, one step at a time. For we are but children to the eyes of adults, for that is the age we are at now. I have just recently become a man, for now I can legally drive a car, vote, and own property. These are the rights of a man and I can now partake in all that comes with it, a right I was not entitled to until now. But there is no ceremony that makes a person an adult, for with it too comes the responsibilities. And it is the people around me who see me as an adult, not the ceremony that makes one such. An adult is an adult because they have grown up and have all the responsibilities with it.
    There is no ceremony that makes a person an adult. For it is the responsibilities that make them such. From this day, I take my future responsibilities as an adult and vow to carry on as a man rather than a boy. /SYS>>

[1,20044,-1,1,1,43741,-4,1,-10001,10001,""Alice M."",""Most adults receive permission on their sixteenth birthday. It is the official age where they can drive; they legally own things without their parents' permission. It is a sign that an adolescent has finished growing into a responsible adult. Teenagers' 16th birthdays are usually marked by a celebration to acknowledge the change. The adults celebrate with the teen because they believe they are mature enough to drive and can be trusted with things. Adolescents celebrate because they get the chance to drive and go places with friends on their own. They feel as though they are becoming a real adult. Adolescents are given this freedom because they have grown out of being children. Although teenagers do have mature bodies they continue to be inexperienced on how to deal with things. They still don't act completely like adults. When teenagers receive their driver's license they feel as though they are mature adults. They feel as though they have been accepted into society. Adolescents believe they are adults even before their sixteenth birthday. They think they know just as much as the adults do. Adolescents don't understand just how mature it is to be a responsible adult. 16-year olds haven't mastered every skill needed to be a true adult. They might know how to drive a car, but they don't know how to be a good worker or how to maintain finances properly. They have to learn these skills when they become adults. 16 is the age adults recognize as the mark between a child and adult. It is the official age an adolescent receives their driver's permit or license, depending on age in the state they reside. This means teenagers who have the moodiness, the voice, and body changes should understand they are not complete adults yet. Most teenagers want to be grown-ups but they don't always know how serious it is. The legal age, 16, in society is when they are recognized as official adults.

Answer: You have 2 errors.

    1) I would recommend that our school should choose books for the library.  In my opinion, computers are
    2) very useful and students should learn to use them at the school. But our school should buy books first
    3) because reading books develops brain and makes people wise. And if students use computers for gaming, we 
    4) should choose books instead of computers. In conclusion, our school should choose books for the library at
    5) the initial stage. When our school has enough money, students should take computer classes too.

    I've checked that answer against http://www.johnaustin.com/essays_and_short_stories_with_answers_3.phtml

    1. If the school chooses books, the students will have better access to more information related to their curriculum. For example, if a student is reading a story book about 
      the rain forest, they can read from a variety of books to find more information about the rain forest. More books would allow students to read books about a variety of topics.
    But if the school chooses computer, the students will have less access to information. A computer is a very limited way of finding information.
    </BR>
    2. Computers would allow students to type papers more efficiently and avoid some of the grammatical errors. Also, the computers would have access to certain programs that could help 
      students with writing. However, books are much better for learning and keeping students focused. A computer only allows the student to surf the net; books can be 
      opened to a specific page that is needed for reference.
    But if the shcool choses books, the libraries will be more organized and there will be less wasted books. With computer access, students do not have to take care 
      of the computers by keeping track of the computers or putting them away at the end of class.
    </BR>

    Computers are not a good reason to give up books. Books teach good study skills and make students more focused. They help students find the exact piece of information they need.
    Computers are too limited to be a better option.
    </BR>
    I conclude by saying that the school should buy books since they provide better learning experiences and are more economical.

    ""Most important characteristic for success in life? What is it and why? Use specific reasons and examples.""[/INST]

     ""Most important characteristic for success in life?"""" is a challenging problem because everyone has varying views on what the most importan
   task should be to achieve it. For example, one person might believe that a goal-oriented mindset
   is essential, while another individual may think that perseverance is more crucial.
   
    To decide which characteristic is the most essential, I
    would evaluate
    which trait is necessary for all other success habits and skills to function properly. I reason that in order
   for perseverance to be able.
   To continue, grit must exist. So therefore grit and determination would be the most valuable quality
   to strive for.
   One reason that determination is important is because it allows a person to keep
   working hard and
   pursuing goals even when the road gets tough. Additionally, the willingness to endure setbacks allows
   people to
   continue to strive towards their aspirations. If a person is not persisting and has
   stopped trying, then their goals cannot be achieved regardless of other qualities or abilities they might possess. Therefore, even though certain skills, such as diligence and perseverance,
   and important for success, they are dependent on determination to be of much use. Therefore, my judgement is that
   determination is the highest quality to strive for in order to achieve accomplishment.

    0001 ]""The question is in the <<SYS>> tag, and the rest is just instructions to the system. So far, so good.
Next, I want to create the <<SYS>>.

So I'm going to use a ""new"" in front of my <<SYS>> tag, then make it a variable. Now, when I'm in 0001, I can ask the variables.

    ""]""(1)R,
    ""/Sys"";
There's my 500th line of code! This is what adds the <<SYS>> back into the output. So:

The last two lines make sure 0001 will be in the output to keep the program running. 
I can see that the output is:

Not bad; the <SYS> tag contains the question. And the /SYS>] ends the program.
When I'm in 0001, the <<SYS>> is not going to be added to the system output unless I tell it to be added! So I need to add:

    <CHOICE.> China - The traditional Chinese New Year celebration is fun and festive. It's a time to get together with family, eat lucky foods, and make a fresh start. There is a lot of preparation leading up to the new year. Families clean their houses to sweep away any bad fortune and decorate with red to bring in good luck. Children are given red envelopes filled with money by their elders and firecrackers are set off before midnight to ward off evil spirits. The foods eaten for good luck are oranges, tangerines, fish, and dumplings. The dumplings (jiaozi in Chinese) are handmade by a family, symbolizing unity and family togetherness. The new year celebration is a highlight for the Chinese and they are happy to share it with people from other lands.<

I would tell myself to spend more time abroad and to study more languages. I would also make more of an effort in the relationships I'm careless about now. I wish I'd been less stubborn and listened to other people when I had the chance. I would do everything to make my life easier and better. I know that I would not be very good at following my own advice from the future. I would not be able to stay as focused as I am now with all the distractions around back then. But I would still try. I would make an effort to be better than I was in my younger years. I would try to correct some of my mistakes.

    Here is your response.
Here is the start of your response:
""If I could go back in time, I would go back to the Victorian era. During that time, women did not have any rights, and were often controlled by their husbands. I would go back to spread awareness about women’s rights and show the Victorian women how great they can be. By doing this, I could change the future and help women today. I know it sounds crazy to go back in time and give a speech, but my time machine would allow me to do it. I would go back and give a presentation in a school, and tell the women how amazing they are and give them the confidence to stand up for themselves. I believe that if enough women were inspired by my speech, they would then go back to their homes and families and do the same. I think it would be a beautiful, circular pattern of inspiration and change if I were able to go back. I would do everything I can to help women who needed it.
</OUTRESPONSE>

This was interesting to do, but I wish there had been a little more about the story. I was given a response about why I wanted to go back, but it wasn’t particularly well connected to why I would go back. Overall, interesting, and good.

    The invention of the light bulb has been most beneficial for people in my country.[linebreak]The invention of the light bulb has brought great
    convenience to people because of its practical value.Light bulbs emit light that makes it possible to
    read, work, study, play and do all sorts of other activities.[linebreak]The first electric light bulbs were expensive and had only limited uses,
    but their use gradually expanded because of research and development in the 1900s. By the late 1900s, light bulbs were inexpensive and
    could be used to light up people?s homes, businesses, and streets.[linebreak]Since then, energy-saving light bulbs have been invented which
    further improved people?s lives.The greatest benefit is that light bulbs bring light into darkness!
    [linebreak]It?s the simple light bulb that lets people live and work as they pleased without having to always
    work and live by natural light. [linebreak]And if they wanted to read or study, they could do so at any time,
    in any place.For a long time, before the lightbulb, there was no electricity at night.
    Therefore, lightbulbs were invented and have been the most important and beneficial invention for people in my country because of the
    convenience and benefit electric lightbulbs brought us.

    I think that one of the most important qualities of a good roommate is patience.  When you have to share a bedroom with someone else, there are always going to be annoyances to deal with-like the smell of a roommates cooking or the noise of playing a video game.  If you have good patience, you can deal with your roommate better without letting things bother you too much, and you can talk to your roommate without making a big fuss.  This also helps to make you better able to get along with others in general, so it helps in other contexts too.
    Another good quality is a willingness to compromise.  In life you can't always have your own way, and often you need to consider the preferences of the people around you.  Good roommates realize this and are open to compromises about small matters, like when to vacuum or what TV shows to watch.  By compromising, you won't keep doing things that annoy your roommates even if you don't notice, and you'll also be happier about sharing the responsibilities of living together.
    In conclusion, patience and a willingness to compromise are important qualities for a good roommate to have.   By having these qualities, you'll have an easier time getting along with your roommate without being bothered by small annoyances.  This means that you'll be happier about having a roommate than people might expect.

    ""Escaping Stress and Difficulties""
    Your task is to answer the question in your own words, citing examples. Remember that it is essential to give explanations and details supporting your opinions. In your answer, give examples, reasons from experience or knowledge of problems in modern living, and your opinions of how to deal with them.
    <</SYS>> <</SYS>>
    Some ways I have found best for reducing the stress and difficulties of modern life are through reading, working in the garden, and meditation.
    Reading, both fiction and nonfiction, is a great pastime and can help to escape everyday problems. Through reading I am able to travel to other lands and visit other times. Reading transports me to another place where I can forget about my problems and immerse myself in literature.
    I find gardening therapeutic when I am not able to go away or take time off from work. Gardening also helps me relax when I am experiencing stress. With the fresh air and the activity of working and tending a garden, I can free my mind and work out problems I may be experiencing. Also, being able to walk among plants and flowers puts me in touch with nature and helps remind me the world does not revolve around my problems.
    Finally, meditation helps greatly. Finding time to meditate and sit quietly is very beneficial to my stress. As I sit and think, I am able to organize my thoughts and problems into workable solutions. Meditation also helps me see problems in an improved perception.
    I find the methods of reading, gardening, and meditation work very well in reducing the stress and strain of work and daily life. All are effective in finding balance and restoring order to the world that too often seems chaotic and out of control.

    <<LAST>> 210  DUP GET LEN REPEAT REDUCE SUB 0 <> SWAP IF DROP EXIT DROP
    <</FRAME>>
<SUPER>

    You don't want to use a frame; you don't have to keep track of any state variables.
    A frame is for keeping track of variables between calls to the frame. You're
    creating the whole input/output sequence at once.

    But you need to process the lines in order.

    Also note that GET returns a list; you need to call DUP first or else it won't
    get rid of the SUPER.

[INPUT]
The company wants to build a large factory. There are many disadvantages to having a factory near our community. First, pollution from the factories is inevitable. Some of the pollution produced by factory work will be released into the air and will contribute to our carbon footprint, which is detrimental to the environment. The factory workers' cars will add vehicles to our streets, adding to traffic congestion. There are some obvious advantages to the new factory. A large factory means jobs will be created, increasing spending power. Also, some of the materials used by the factory may even be local which would minimize pollution due to transport. Overall, I do not support the factory being built. The pollution is too large a concern. I would rather the jobs be created but not at the expense of pollution. [/INPUT]

    ""The new movie theater would provide a great entertainment venue for my neighborhood. It would be nice to be able to walk to more kinds of entertainment events. Also it would bring in tax revenue.
 
    However it would probably be expensive for the city to build it, and the tax revenue wouldn't entirely offset that expense in the short term. Also while I enjoy watching movies, I am more concerned by the problem of traffic, and fear that the increased traffic from the new movie theater would impose on resident's quiet street environments.""[/INST]

    2) <<INST>>
    ""I do NOT support building a movie theater in my neighborhood. It will only bring more traffic and noise into my quiet residential neighborhood. Residents already have to deal with lots of traffic from the main intersection. My neighbors also already have a hard time parking at their homes on weekends-- the movie theater will only add to those parking challenges. I also think the new theater will make the neighborhood less child friendly. While I still love going to the movies, for older folks like me I'd be happy to drive a little outside my neighborhood to see a movie instead of bringing movie traffic into their neighborhood.""[/INST]

    >[S1]>You ask <<SYS>> what the most important skill for success in today's world is, and why. Here is why he thinks it's the ability to communicate clearly and logically:<[S2]><<SYS>>
    The most important skill for success in today's world is the ability to communicate clearly and logically. It's important because in today's competitive economy, having good technical skills only gives you a chance. If you don't communicate well, you won't get hired, you won't get clients, and you won't have much success. Communication skills are vital not just for job interviews but also for negotiating, selling, marketing, meeting new people, etc. Clear and logical communication makes you look professional, polished, and confident. It enables you to express your ideas, impressions, or opinions. The world runs on communication these days and the best professionals are the ones who can best communicate their ideas. In the end communication wins over technical skills.

    >[S1]>How do you think communication skills affect people?

    [SYS] ><[S2]>>Communication skills have a huge impact. They affect everything from your grades to your employability to your chances of getting a raise. Better communication leads to getting better grades because the teachers value someone who is well informed and well spoken. It leads to getting hired or promoted because companies and employers like confident, skilled employees. Good communication means you're more likely to keep your job because you can convey ideas clearly. And good communication leads to more clients, because in today's world the public looks for professionals who can talk clearly. So communication skills aren't just important. They are essential for success in today's world.

    >[S1]>How do you think you have improved your communication skills throughout the year?

    [SYS] ><[S2]>>I have improved my communication skills in many ways throughout the year, both in and out of school. One way is by taking a speech class to improve my speaking skills.

    In my opinion an important skill people should learn to be successful nowadays
    is learning about entrepreneurship.

    Because nowadays, it more
    difficult for people to be employed and they should have the ability to start their own
    business to make a livelihood.

    With the rise of internet in recent years, starting small business has not been easier.

    There are a number of resources
    that provides a wealth of information and guides on
    starting a new business successfully.

    With the right skill and the appropriate plan, there is nothing stopping people from
    starting their own business in order to earn a better and steady income.

    【本题的轮转语和思路】
    本题为关于购物中心在自己的区域补充内容；甚是早有“蔓延”的悠望，从幼时起的扩大目标；
    而为其资质所赐而岼宫轮到留守，采奎吕而未寒，执苍吗眼，胸有诸葛复之斗志；
    在中区域做到做到这么好凑鼻，做到做到这么不爽。 对，就是好这么不舒服；
    中间大大暖落，在假想的循迹，而为肛门赎罪遮顿，甚至为射飞将剑穿針之下。
    最后不如不说做也没话好说了，在炮火鹿撤兎，也许会纳入购物中心的轮轴。

    There are several reasons.

    20171220 20:21:03 [WARN] [SYS:999999] [Bot(SYS)]
[/Sys>][SYS]]

    Shopping malls bring convenience and comfort to local residents. It is estimated that a new shopping mall should improve the living condition of local residents. It is said that more than 60 percent of the residents in China now living in urban areas. Compared with the past, residents of cities today have become more affluent and better educated. Therefore, a shopping mall close to their neighborhoods is very necessary. It should be the answer to the modern residents.

    Another reason why I support is the shopping mall can offer jobs to hundreds in our neighborhood. And the retail market has already become the largest employer in the world. According to statistics, in developed economies, every 100 yuan (euros or dollars) purchased in a shopping mall can create one job. In the process of operating a shopping mall, it is said, hundreds of jobs will be generated. This is another good reason why I agree to build a shopping mall in our neighborhood.

    In this way, a shopping mall would provide people of this area a better life in many aspects. That is why I support this plan.

    [TEST] <<INST>>
        <</TEST>>
        Why do I think some people are attracted to dangerous sports?
    I think people like me are attracted to dangerous sports because we want to do what seems impossible, or we want to experience fear and adrenaline as a natural high. We think we have nothing to lose--if we're injured, die, or are simply humiliated and shamed, no one will care. It's easier for 
    us to break our bones than it is for someone more sensitive (like our parents, who might disapprove--or like our partners, who might be uncomfortable with us putting our lives in harm's way) to. Many of us also want to feel alive and free from worrying abut our futures or our finances--it feels like being in 
    school or working a job. We want to take advantage of youth and being strong, athletic, and fearless (or at least, fearless enough to take action). We think we can do well as long as we work hard.

    [TEST] <<INST>>
        <</TEST>>
        What do people gain when they choose dangerous sports over safer activities? <<INST>>
        <</TEST>>
            We gain experience and the right to tell a story that impresses and inspires people; and also, the chance to find out how capable we are of enduring physical and emotional trauma.

    [TEST] <<INST>>
        <</TEST>>
        Why do I prefer to choose dangerous activities instead of playing it safe? <<INST>>
        <</TEST>>
            We don't think we're playing it safe--sailing through classes and work feels safe, but boring. Going to work, having a stable relationship, and having a reliable income are all forms of safety--but our work and lives feel dull. We look for danger and risk.

What I learned from that exercise is that if you are not attentive when using these types of methods,
the whole system can explode on untended side effects. I learned a lot here by experimenting.

### 0.2 The system

From that I experimented I made the system more stable and readable. The core structure changed a little 
that I will present in the next chapter. However for now I will show briefly. You can see that the structure is quite similar on chapter"

    ㋒
    <</OUTS>>
    I know from my own experience that I have visited numerous museums in my life. I grew up going to the science museums, art museums, and history museums near my home quite often. I also visited museums and other historical sites when I traveled both by myself and with my family. When I asked myself why I liked to go to the museums when I was younger, as well as why I do so today, I could not really come up with a good reason. I did enjoy the new experiences and new information I gained at the various museums I visited, although now that I reflect upon my childhood and early adolescent museum visits, it is more to do with my parent's desire to take me out rather than having a need to visit all the museums.

    ㋒
    <</OUTS>>
    Some people believe people visit museums to learn about the objects the museums exhibit and to learn about the time period those objects were originally part of. The actual objects help bring to life the time periods of history. For example, it is easier to grasp the time period of Civil War era when you view an original Confederate soldier's hat in a museum, as opposed to reading about the hat from description in a book. Additionally, viewing the hat makes the history more personal as you are viewing a real hat worn by an actual Civil War soldier, not just studying a picture of a hat.

    ㋒
    <</OUTS>>
    Other reasons people cite for visiting a museum are to understand the culture and artistic expression of a different country by actually going to the museums there. In this way, they get to study the artistic output of the country without seeing it through the lens of people in their own culture. This is especially the case when people visit museums in the country they are traveling to. By being in the country and going to the museums, the culture of that place and its artistic expression is more vibrant and has an impact on the spectator than viewing reproductions of the artistic works in the spectator's home country.

    A) I have several reasons why people visit museums. The most important reason why I think people visit museums is to learn. 
    By visiting museums, people can learn about the past, about important historic events, and about other cultures. There are museums about everything--art, ancient cities, civilizations, the American West, American presidents, and many other topics. 
     There is so much to learn about, and museums are a good way to do it.

    B) One reason why people visit museums is to get information. Many museums have extensive collections of data, facts, and information that is very useful. Students studying for a report or term paper may visit a museum to get information about a historic event or scientific process that they are writing about. Other people may visit museums to find facts they can use in other types of reports, speeches, or essays.

    C) A second reason people visit museums is to enjoy art. Museums often have beautiful, interesting paintings, sculptures, or other examples of art. Viewers can study these and gain an appreciation for them. Seeing great works of art in a museum gives people enjoyment.

    D) A final reason people visit museums is to gain insight or understanding. People can view artifacts, read about history, or examine a work of art and then reflect on its meaning or value. For example, paintings that had been hidden for hundreds of years may suddenly become famous when put on display in a museum. Museum visits can create new understandings and insights.

    Roads are the most popular method of getting around in the modern world, and have been since man first came up with the idea. For example, when mankind decided that a wheel could be used over just pushing around a heavy object, roads and highways were used to get the wheel and cart around. It was one of mankind's first great inventions. But for that same reason, there is a great deal of infrastructure dedicated just to getting around efficiently. Most of our cities are built around road systems, as is our suburban areas. Roads get us everywhere faster and more efficiently, but they take up a lot of space, and require frequent maintenance. That is where public transportation comes in. Public Transportation takes a large part of the burden of moving people from roads by moving more people in a less efficient manner. While it takes longer to get to places on public transportation, there does not have to be as much space dedicated to it. There are places where people could walk instead of driving to get anywhere, but roads are not only a method of getting people where they have to go, but also a method of moving goods and services. It is much easier to transport massive and bulky loads on roads than it is public transportation. The reason many cities, including the Washington DC metro and the BART system in San Francisco, are inefficient is because the public transportation takes up so much of the space that has been given over to roads, rather than roads taking up space used for public transportation. Government spends far more on roads than it does on public transportation simply because roads are much more efficient. But as more people flock into city areas, and the space becomes more and more constrained, public transportation needs to expand. But when governments are going to have to choose between the";Shud goverments spnd more mony on improveng roads and highwas, or shud goverments spnd more mony on improveng public transportashion (buses, tranes, subways)?

    In general, people are living longer now. Discuss the causes of this phenomenon. Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.[/INST]

    
    [ESSAY]
    The first cause of longer lives today is advances in public health. In the past, many people died from illnesses that today can be cured or prevented, such as polio or diabetes. Today, most of those illnesses can be diagnosed early and treated effectively. Vaccinations have been developed to prevent illnesses caused by viruses and bacteria. For example, a vaccination to prevent the cholera epidemic in the 19th century has saved millions of lives.

The second cause is improvements in standards of living, especially better nutrition. Most people are better nourished today than people were in the past. As a result, they often live longer. For example, fewer people die in childhood from malnutrition than from previous generations.

The third reason has to do with the environment. In the past, people died earlier from injuries, diseases spread by insects or other environmental factors. In modern life, people have fewer life-threatening accidents and illnesses related to environmental conditions. For example, a simple case of the flu might have been fatal for someone who lived in the past but is rarely fatal today.

\end{pre}

Answer: \section{Explanation}

I took it as:

\begin{code}
 35: 82:2: < (start)
    87:2: (start) <

 (start) 849659165839459283: (end) 0:0

 (start) 87: (end) >

 31: 87:2: <123459165839459283:3:1

 33: 87:4: >198475939459283:3:1

 (end) 82: (start) > <21: 87:2:<846451659234590283:4:1
\end{code}

The second line is in-between lines between ""start"" and ""end"" so it's probably wrong, or I made some mistake somewhere.

The first line is:

\begin{code}
 35: 82:2: < (start)
    87:2: (start) <
    37: 82:4: > (start) > 2237591984563";"""People living longer now. Causes? Discuss with reasons and details.""";"<s> [INST] <<SYS>>

    1. You can see that I want students to take topic from me via '<INST>';

        1. <INST_CATEGORY_NAME> allows to separate questions and answers based on category.
        2. <SYS_TEXT> will contain short text of system instruction.
    4. Then we loop the questions and answers together and store into $inst, which will be printed later.
    5. We parse and split $inst based on <INST_CATEGOR_NAME> and <SYS_TEXT> and store into new variables for each component.

   The dictionary definition of a neighbor is: a person living nearby. This tells me that a neighbor is anyone living near me. However, not every person who lives near me has the qualities of a good neighbor, and I will tell you what qualities I think a good neighbor has.
    <BLANK/> I think a good neighbor is someone who respects your boundaries, but also is available if you need something. By respecting your boundaries, I mean they don't intrude on your private property. If you don't want someone on your land, they should respect that. However, they should also be friendly and available. For example, if you drop and break a glass in your backyard, your neighbor could be someone you can easily ask for a broom and dustpan, without feeling like you are intruding or invading their space. They would gladly help you and not become irritated when they see you.  <BLANK/>
    I also think a good neighbor is someone you can easily approach on any topic. You should feel welcomed when visiting that neighbor, even if you have never met before.
    <BLANK/> I think a good neighbor should have good communication skills, and be willing to talk about subjects other than the weather, or where you work. They are friendly and respect confidentiality if you talk about personal subjects.
    <BLANK/> Finally, a good neighbor is someone who acts like a good citizen in their community. For example, if they see something that needs fixing or attention, they will help instead of just complaining to everyone else, saying 'someone should do that.' Instead of complaining, they will take action.

<P>
A good supervisor has strong leadership skills, effective communication skills, an ability to delegate tasks, and a commitment to providing constructive feedback to employees. Here are some specific examples of qualities that make a supervisor effective:
<OL>

<LI>Leadership skills. A good supervisor can motivate employees and create a positive work environment. For example, a supervisor might set clear goals and expectations for the team, provide resources and support to help employees succeed, and encourage collaboration amongst team members.</LI>

<LI>Communication skills. An effective supervisor must be able to communicate clearly and effectively with employees. This includes giving instructions, providing feedback, and listening to ideas and concerns.</LI>

<LI>Delegation skills. A supervisor needs the flexibility to delegate tasks to employees based on their skills and strengths. This allows the supervisor to focus on higher-level tasks while ensuring important tasks are completed.</LI>

<LI>Feedback skills. An effective supervisor gives constructive, timely feedback to employees on their performance. This includes both praise and areas for improvement, delivered in a respectful and helpful manner.</LI>

</OL></P>

The supervisor has a critical role in setting the tone and culture of a work team. Effective communication, delegation, and feedback from the supervisor greatly impact team dynamic s and employee satisfaction.

    ""Other reasons people work besides money? Discuss with specific examples and details.""[/INST]

     ""Here are some of the other reasons why people work besides for money:
- Satisfaction: While most people say they work mainly for the paycheck, there is no denying that satisfaction and meaning in a career is extremely important to most people. Finding a job that you enjoy or is fulfilling can be just as important to some people as the paycheck they receive.
- Opportunity: An additional reason people work is to have the opportunity to travel, network, and learn more in general. Even if the current job is less-than-perfect, they can enjoy learning opportunities and the chance to better themselves.
- Responsibility: Some people work because they need to take care of their family or simply because they feel it's their duty. While this is more common in earlier eras, responsibility to one's family or country still drives many people. For example, parents need to support their kids and care for their health, and countries often need workers to grow.
- Enjoyment: There are some workers who enjoy their job and feel a passion or inspiration for this career. Though they could pursue something else for more money, they stay for the enjoyment it brings.""[/TEXT]

Comment: Does this answer your question? [How to get an element of a list which starts with a substring?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1663807/how-to-get-an-element-of-a-list-which-starts-with-a-substring)

Comment: I think you can iterate over the list of sentences, and search through the first 14 words until you found the question...

Comment: `sentences = [...]  #  List of strings.

sentences = ['This is question 1.',
       'This is question 2.',
       'This is question 3.']

question_start = ['What change would make your hometown more appealing to people your age? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.']

for sentence in sentences[:]: # Check the first 14 words against question_starts

  j = 0
  while j < 14: # j is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
    if sentence[:j + 1].strip().lower() in question_starts:
      print(question_starts)
      print(sentence)
      break
    j += 1`

But it doesn't seem to print anything.

Comment: @SarahHoos It works for me. I added it to the original question.

Comment: I am sure you are on to something there. You seem to find it. I would say try to simplify that a bit :) Thanks though. I'll update the question as it evolves.

Comment: @SarahHoos I updated my answer. It should work now

Comment: So this is what you came up with using the hint.  Not bad - but I bet there's more ways to do it...

Comment: A little more explanation would be nice. Like what parts of the code do - maybe it could be more clear with better naming.

Comment: @JasonC Oh I'm sorry, I just looked at it again. I see now he's doing a bunch of checks to make sure the user typed the proper things and in the proper order before he gets to the part where he actually does any of the processing.

Comment: @JasonC I do agree though, that I can make it a much better looking program by just renaming a bunch of variables a bit, because at the moment I did keep everything very descriptive.

Comment: @JasonC and just renaming some variable names would also make it more readable

Comment: @TheVillageIdiot if you find it confusing, please let me know so that I can clarify. All the comments are in the code. (I just edited them in.)

Comment: Thanks for all the feedback. I know I can make this a much more polished piece of work. And with comments. I'll try to do that going forwards with this series.</s>"

Comment: Thanks for the sample.  I'm trying to get the sample through a few of the things in my stack and I think you did something that I did that didn't work.  I'll see if I can figure out what it is...

Comment: I also tried `print(response_print(s.select_one(t.user_input)))` but it prints nothing. I'm not sure I'm selecting properly in this case, as my understanding is the user is selecting 'intelligence' in their first selection.  The second selection (with the `t.user_input`) just returns a blank.

Comment: I'm also not seeing if the user made a selection in their first selection, I get no response printed from `print(response_print(s.select_one('Which one of these dis characteristics is most important to you?', ['intelligence', 'sense of humor', 'reliability']) ))`

Comment: I see a difference between yours and mine.  You are not putting the first selection and the second selection into the `t.user_input()`  You have a `response_print(t) ` but are not passing the second selection's input into `t`.   I'm curious if the second selection even gets past `t = '...` on your end.  Try setting a breakpoint at `t = response_print(t2) ` and run your code without the `print()` to see if the second selection gets to that point"

    【文の内容】
    Your answer :
	Yes, they are so students can have plenty of time to work on them.
	Maybe, if they are not assigned every day, students will not learn to plan and execute a task over a longer period of time.
	No, students already have too much homework. This is the most important reason.

	I agree with the people who say students have too much homework. They are forced to read for a half hour at least a couple of nights every week. This is a real problem not only for students but also for their families' relationships. When I have a stack of homework, there's not really much time for me to spend with my family. 
	I also think too much homework is a wasteful distraction from learning itself. I think schools should not only care about what students are learning but also how they are learning. 
	Too much homework in fact makes students lose interest in learning, especially for younger children. After coming home from school, I do not feel motivated. The homework I have to finish is just too much. Every day after school, I am not even in the mood for sports and physical exercise, not to mention doing other fun activities I really want to do. 
	In brief, I think schools should reduce homework load to a minimum. There is no real benefit to giving students a lot of homework. What is the point if this is distracting them from actually learning and experiencing something more interesting? 
	I think less homework will also benefit students' relationships with their families, and themselves. I can spend more time on sports and extracurricular activities, which are more rewarding in the long run for developing skills to use in the future. What schools should care about is not only students' test score at the end of every semester, but how students will be in their future.

You have to create an initial program that parses the string for topics. Topics are presented as prompts of two lines of text separated with a blank line. The first string describes a task that the user should complete. The second string contains instructions. We expect that prompts will continue to be sent for additional tasks. If the program terminates when it encounters an input string that is not a valid prompt, you will be graded as incorrect but will also not count against your program's grade, providing that the program attempts to parse the input string before failing. If the program simply terminates and does not attempt to parse the input string, it will be graded as incorrect and count against your grade.

We will provide the initial prompt, but you will need to parse additional prompts on your own. After we provide an explanation of the prompts, we will ask you to parse the first prompt that you will receive. You have to complete the following tasks:

Task		|Instructions
:---:		|:---:
		|1. Declare a string called PROMPT and write a variable called INPTHAT stores the input string
		|2. Read INPTHAT into PROMPT.
		|3. Use a nested IF/THEN/ELIF/ELSE statement to test if the prompt is valid. If it is valid,
		|4. Parse the two lines of text contained in the prompt. Create two new variables: Topic (containing 
		|the topic as described) and Instructions (containing the instructions to execute).
		|5. Exit the program using the IF/THEN/ELIF/ELSE statement.

    I don't feel I have any obligation to choose a specific foreign country but I can choose countries that interest me.

    As the second largest country in the world, Russia is the largest country I can name. I don't know much about Russia but I think it probably has many natural resources so it's rich. I know Russia has many cold regions in Siberia. It might be fun to visit Siberia in the winter to go snowboarding.  Russia has about 110 million people. I was surprised to hear there are more people in Russia than in 27 African countries combined. However, most Russians live near the border of Europe and less than half of Russia's land is habitable.

    China is the most populous country, with over 1.3 billion people. It is the most densely populated country. China ranks first in a long list of many categories. Since Chinese is an important language, I'm interested in visiting there.

    India is the second most populous country, with over 1 billion people. The Himalaya Mountains rise along the border between India and China. I would like to see the Himalayas at least once. Besides that, I have no special attachment to India, but it is the birthplace of Buddhism. Buddhism is also popular in Japan. At least in the Buddhist pilgrimage sites, maybe I could get some feeling of the ancient religion.

    The United States is another country I would like to visit. As the third largest country, it might be considered natural to visit there when visiting other large countries. The Grand Canyon is an amazing natural wonder that I would like to see.  If I could visit all three of Russia, China, and India, then the USA would probably be the fourth large foreign country I would most be interested in visiting.

Comment: [Your teacher] ""Would you like to hear my thoughts on the matter?"", prompts ""No thank you""

Comment: Your problem seems to be in the code that runs after ""prompt"", not in the text you've posted. So why have you posted all that text? Why not just post the code you've written, so we can tell where the error is? Or at least edit the question to clearly explain the problem; what behaviour the code _does_ seem to be having. Posting masses of irrelevant text just wastes our time.

Comment: That said, as I suspected, I haven't looked at the code closely enough to comment further. But I suspect you've simply forgotten a comma in an if statement, or one of the semicolons in ""for"" lines are in the wrong place, so no output statement is ever run. But I can't tell because I can't check the actual statements.

Comment: I agree, I will be clear as possible here next time. The reason I posted that text is because I am following a tutorial and the instructor gave me the full program but I do not know why it doesn't work. The reason I did ask is because I thought that maybe the instructor overlooked something that was necessary when I compiled it. It was a large part of my work and I did not want to leave anything out.

Comment: I do have a comma as well as semicolons in all the right places. Sorry if this wasn't clear.

Comment: Just show exactly the code you're talking about. You're saying it's ""the next part"", but that's not helpful to anyone.

Comment: I'm sorry this was long. But because of the size of my program I do not think I could post everything I have done. Here is the exact code. The ""Instruction Sequence"": and below that the code I typed out.

Comment: Yes, show us the bit of code that comes directly after the line which starts ""prompt"" - nothing before or after that.

Comment: Ok, here it is.

     I want to meet the famous football star Lionel Messi. I don't remember much of his soccer career but I do remember his team, FC Barcelona. I chose Messi because he's a good role model who is always smiling, has a positive attitude, and has a love for soccer that I try to have. As a person who has grown up and still loves soccer, it'd be pretty epic to be able to watch him play and maybe even talk with him.

I would also love to know their tips about how they memorize lines, choreograph dance moves, or learn how to perform tricks.

    I think I would base the holiday on one of my favorite characters, Gandalf. The most obvious holiday would be for the wizard and for the Lord of the Rings as a whole would be Tolkien's Birthday, on January 3rd. In the books, it's a happy, jubilant day in which all people of honor are invited to the great feast held by Bilbo and Frodo. I'd celebrate it just like this. Have a really big feast (if possible) and invite people wearing pointy hats or dressed as wizards and elves. On the day on the books and the day of the holiday we'd read all or part of The Hobbit. I'd get people to sing songs like ""Farewell Song of the Elves."" We'd make a big decoration that reminds us how Tolkien's books can bring happiness. It's a story about courage, friendship, honor, loyalty, and the power of friendship and love. Tolkien's influence was everywhere. Not just the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, his essays and other works have influenced our culture.

What Person to Honor?

I would create a new holiday celebrating and honoring my best friend, Nina. My holiday would be celebrated on my birthday, July 8th. There would be many ways to celebrate this holiday, many similar ways to the way I currently celebrate my birthday. For example, some of the regular ways I celebrate my birthday is by going out to dinner, taking a trip, and spending time with family. There would of course, be some differences, for instance, I would plan to give Nina a gift on this day. I would likely give her a gift in front of the entire high school, or in front of the entire town. In addition, I would also have a parade in her honor and name this new holiday after her. Another way to celebrate her would be to plan a carnival celebrating her. Finally, I would also make this new holiday a legal paid holiday and have the whole town of people take a day off from work and school to remember Nina on my birthday. I would make this day be remembered and honored by the entire town for all of my life.

    [INST <<S,R,E>> <<SYS]]Your answer: You've chosen a very interesting topic. Although books are important in developing analytical skills, experince teaches you about things that are impossible to learn through books. Experience allows students to better understand how to apply analytical skills to real-world settings, because many textbooks lack a realistic context. Although both are important, experience is more important overall. As George Bernard Shaw once said, ""The true university of these days is the streets.""[SYS</INST>>]

    Your task is to write an essay (about 300-350 words) in response to a question. The topic will be provided below.

    Do you agree or disagree that a person should never give up? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion. [/INST]
\end{code}

I would like Python to parse all the questions starting with \begin{code}
<<SYS>>
\end{code} and then take every question inside the \begin{code}
<>
\end{code} tags and pass them into a new `question` variable. So if I had 3 questions in my example, I would have `question1`, `question2`, `question3`. I want to pass them to a new function with argument `question`.

This is what I tried:

\begin{code}
with open('instructions.txt') as f:
    questions = list()
    for line in f:          #This line is what I added
        if '<<SYS>>' in line:
            questions.extend(line.split('>')[1:])
    for question in questions:
        print(question)
\end{code}

But nothing is printed for me. I guess the line extension is incorrect. But I am new to Python/python scripting in general.

Answer: Here's one way of doing it. The questions are stored in `QUESTIONS` as the string of text between the initial \begin{code}
<<SYS>>
\end{code} and the final \begin{code}
</SYS>>
\end{code}. I'm not entirely convinced this is your intent based on your example.

\begin{code}
questions = []
with open('instructions.txt') as f:
    for line in f:
        if '<<SYS>>' in line:

Comment: You can't pass just a string argument to a slot. You need a `slot = int(input('Enter your age: '))`. You *could* do it with a different prompt, the way you've done it is to catch the response to the input statement, but it's not common.

Comment: Thanks, but it's specifically for this prompt (Which thing is the hardest part of learning a foreign language?) where my code is failing with my bot entering [SYS] mode. I'm trying to figure out how to get it to skip and enter the mode when it see it, instead of when there is no response

Answer: Based on your sample responses it sounds like the first word of the input matches the pattern you are using to decide whether to go into SYS mode. In your code, you don't use the first word when comparing against `[""When"", ""some"", ""others""]`. The code below should work for any input you provide as long as the first word is one of those strings:

     <</SYS>>
     For me, it is safer to make a quick judgment when meeting someone for the first time. Although it may be wrong in some instances, first impressions can usually be relied on.

     If a person comes across well at first meeting, he or she probably feels good about meeting you later. Likewise, if someone seems strange or even rude at first meeting, he or she will not likely give you anything important in later meetings. In other words, if you like or trust your first impression of someone, it's likely that person will like you too and you can trust what he or she will say later.

     However if you don't like or trust your first impression, you can trust even less what the person will say and do later. So while your first impression of someone may be wrong, I prefer to act on what they say from that impression rather than pretend that all people may change.

     [/INST]
     <</SYS>>
    I think it is good to judge someone on first impressions. Although a judgement may not be entirely accurate, it will be in the ballpark and often more correct than wrong. In my experience, you are much more likely to be correct than wrong in thinking someone seems shy or outgoing, rude or polite, etc.

    When two people first meet, they often make judgments very quickly - within five minutes - on a wide range of impressions: age, gender, status, intelligence, attractiveness, health, and so on. Some of these judgements are very accurate - you might feel that someone appears to be very sincere, friendly, and self-confident.

     It seems a shame to ignore these assessments rather than acting on them. If you think someone appears very trustworthy, you can trust his word; if you feel someone lacks confidence, you can be supportive. So a quick judgement made accurately will usually serve you well and you can ignore those made inaccurately just as quickly.

""Though first impressions about a person's character are often correct, it is important to avoid snap judgments. For example, it is normal that a teacher first impressions that a child who came to class late, looking tired and messy, will be disruptive during the rest of the period. However, further interaction suggests that the student simply overslept after an unusually long night of studying and is determined to make up any missed homework. It is better to let initial evaluations form gradually by observing actual behavior over time so as to maintain an open mind.""

    The question is ""Some young children spend a great amount of their time practicing sports..."".
    
    Some children spend a great amount of their time practicing sports.
    
    Some children.
    
    In the past, when I was young, I did spend a great amount of my time practicing sports.
    
    Children today don't spend as much time on sports as when I was young.
    
    Today's youth don't spend as much time on sports as when I was young.
    
    So, I don't know what to say about a great amount of time.

    <</SYS>>
    I was a sportsman in my youth. So, what is time in comparison?
    
    I spend a great deal of time playing video games.
    
    I don't think I wasted my youth by playing sports.
    
    Sports may take up a great deal of time in my youth, but at least I had some experience playing sports.
    
    I have no regrets wasting my time playing sports instead of studying or working.
    
    I did a great deal of learning by playing sports.
    </</SYS>>
    
    
    <</SYS>>
    
    
    I think it's good to learn about sports like baseball and football.
    
    Sports have helped me become better at my job.
    
    Sports are important.
    
    I don't think sports take up a great deal of time.
    
    Children have less free time today.
    
    I think children spend more time on electronics.
    
    Children don't play outside in the woods and fields as much as when I was young.
    
    Children are inside more playing video games.
    
    Electronics can take up all their time.

    The two options have some similarities and differences. A vacation costs some money, but not as much as a car. It’s more convenient to travel to different cities when you have a car, but travelling by plane also has advantages. The main differences are when the costs occur. A vacation costs money all at once. By contrast a car costs much more, but it costs money every month. Since the two options cost money, it’s best to try to use it wisely. I recommend the vacation option because going on vacation is usually a better value than buying a car.

    Movies are popular all over the world. Explain why movies are so popular. Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.[/INST]

    150<</INS>>\ Movies are very popular. One reason is that movies have a wide variety. There are many movies to choose from so someone should be able to find a movie they like. There are all kinds of movies—horror, comedy, science fiction, action, and more! There are also movies for different age groups. There are movies for children, teenagers, and adults. Because movies have so many genres, there is something to appeal to everyone.

    Another reason movies are so popular is that movies can be very exciting. Movie viewers may identify with a character or characters, or may simply be very affected by what's happening on the screen and feel a great variety of feelings. Some movies are very intense and stimulating for the viewers.

    A third reason movies are so popular is that movies reflect real life. They depict the world people live in and many of their concerns. Movies can be very entertaining and sometimes educating.

    These are several reasons why movies are so popular. The large variety of movies available and the emotional, exciting experience that movies provide are two major factors. And people like to see movies because movies help them experience the world.[/INS]]

    4    <<SYS>> 
<<R>> 
        Reason is : 

 Movies has some advantages like real feeling & excitement. They take us away from the everyday routine. Movies are entertaining. They can make you feel more relaxed. Movies can be an antidote from stress, work & problems. We feel as if we are part of the movie that we are watching. They stimulate us in ways that few other things can. We have time to think and dream when we watch a movie or TV show. We escape into someone else’s life for a little while.

 Movies help us learn many useful thing. From history, science to art, they teach us many things. Movies motivate and inspire us. They teach us new things in entertaining ways that we remember longer. We learn from other people’s experience, especially things that are difficult or dangerous for us, such as battles or love. People learn about different cultures and countries. Movies can help improve life. They can change things for better.

<<E>>

4    <<SYS>> 
<<R>> 
        Reason is :

 Movies are good because we are able to see different kinds of people and what they do. We see real people, rather than cartoons or drawings. We feel like we understand the actors, directors and characters. They help us understand other people better. From movies people learn about other places. They can feel what other people feel. They can understand other times and places. Movies are more interesting than talking. We learn from other people’s experiences. We are fascinated watching other people’s lives on a TV screen or up on a big screen in a theatre.

 Movies make people happy! They make them think about something besides day-to-day life. Movies take you for a ride. They can take your mind off your own problems. They distract you. Movies can even have a healing effect. Movies can bring the audience together, even complete strangers. Movies give you something to talk to people about. They are a good reason to meet. They help people understand other people and connect in ways.

     I am writing to complain about the delayed delivery of my new television monitor which I ordered online two weeks ago.
     The order confirmation email stated that I would receive my product within two days. But I am still waiting for delivery almost two weeks after ordering.

[RESP] I'll tell ya which is better. Yer own experiences. Cuz when ya listenin' to yer friends and family ya tend to be biased. You hear what they think is best an the right things to do an you do em that way cuz ya trust and believe 'em. They mean well and ya know they love ya so ya go along with what they say. But their own experiences might not actually reflect ya own thoughts and feelings about stuff. And they might be wrong about certain things or maybe they're just not great examples to learn from for whatever reason. Like maybe they had a lot more opportunities than ya did or they never really got hurt or struggled to recover like ya did.
So with ya own experiences ya got nothin but ya own self to rely on. So ya can't cheat that. You find the real deal lessons to learn. You get true real emotions an reflections. The real highs and lows. You find out what is best for ya and ya own inner values through trial and error an through feelin' it all around ya and not through just hearin' about it from someone else. You really got to be true to what feels right for you and ya learn to trust what's right for ya. ⇾[END]

Thanks for your help and for understanding.

Comment: The code as provided is *not* ""compiled"". It would need to be provided as a template which the `replace` could be applied to. But it also has no *input* so would not compile unless you were trying to compile the code block as given instead of the input.

Comment: I edit the code. I hope its more clear now

Comment: Your `<< SYNTAX >>` has no closing `</SYNTAX>`; I'm assuming you meant it after the line feed? If so, then yes it would compile.

Comment: You seem to have the idea in your head that `REPLACE` in Tcl works like regular expressions in regex-y languages. But it does **not** do that. It does something **different**! So please stop treating it as if it works like regular expressions! See https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/Regex+Pattern for more information.

Answer: As said in comments, you have to \em{\strong{compile}} something for it to execute, and it will not execute a snippet of code like \begin{code}
<<SYS>>
\end{code}.

The simplest way to get something to execute like that is to create a proc command with a body that is an example of that:

\begin{code}
proc SYS body {... code to be executed ...}
\end{code}

and make your \begin{code}
<<SYS>>
\end{code} execute that proc instead:

\begin{code}
<<SYS proc SYS body {body-to-be-executed}>>
\end{code}

If you want to make the arguments to it be passed in with the current value stack of args, you can use `lappend list_of_args` to pass them into the proc:

\begin{code}

This is your essay:

<CR>You need to travel from your home to a place 40 miles (64 kilometers) away. Compare the different kinds of transportation you could use. Tell which method of travel you would choose. Give specific reasons for your choice.

<CR>The different means of transportation you could use to travel 40 miles are:
<CR> car, bus, motorcycle, train, and foot

<CR>If I were traveling 40 miles away, I would most likely take the bus.
<CR>The reasons are:

<CR>-The bus costs very little, usually about $5

<CR>-It is more convenient to take the bus than drive a car because: you don't have to worry about parking, finding a stop, and traffic.
<CR>-You can relax while traveling without worrying about driving or getting a ticket.

<CR>I feel walking 40 miles would be far too time-consuming. You couldn't carry any luggage.

<CR>A motorcycle would make the trip faster than either bus or cars, but that is assuming no accidents, no getting pulled over.

<CR>Trains are generally used for larger distances, so 40 miles may be out of the question.
